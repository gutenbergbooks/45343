<h1 class='c005'>THE ADVENTURE GIRLS AT HAPPINESS HOUSE</h1>
</div>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch01' class='c006'><i>Chapter I</i><br /> <br />BRIARHURST</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>With a final chug and screech of brakes the
train slid to a halt before the two story
frame building that did duty for a railway station
in the little college town of Briarhurst.</p>

<p class='c008'>A group of girls proceeded with much hilarity
and little speed to transport themselves and their
luggage from the railway coach to the station
platform. From there they viewed the rusty bus
that was to transport them up the hill to the college
grounds.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It will never hold all of us and our luggage,”
Carol Carter declared with firm conviction. “Perhaps
we had better walk.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Janet Gordon looked at the dusty road winding
up the hill behind the station and then at the
bus. “You can walk,” she said. “I’ll take a chance
on this antiquated vehicle.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Are you the six young ladies goin’ to Briarhurst?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The girls turned to see a wizened old man approaching
from the station. “If ye are, climb
aboard. I’m the bus driver.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll wager the bus is even older than he is,”
Madge Reynolds murmured to Valerie Wallace.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Will the contraption hold together?” Carol
wanted to know.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s been a-runnin’ for nigh onto twenty years
and ain’t fell apart yet,” the driver said, climbing
into his seat and waiting for the girls to get
aboard.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That isn’t saying it never will,” Phyllis Elton
commented.</p>

<p class='c008'>After much dickering the girls got into the bus,
their luggage for the most part piled on the roof,
and the ancient vehicle with its ancient driver
started with a roar.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It reminds me of a peanut roaster,” Carol
murmured. “The way the radiator is steaming
and the noise it makes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Everything but the peanuts,” agreed Janet.
“Which reminds me, I hope dinner is early.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dinner is at seven,” the driver informed them
conversationally.</p>

<p class='c008'>The bus started the long tedious climb up the
hillside and the driver settled back comfortably
in his seat. He was in no hurry.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I thought Briarhurst was a prosperous college,”
Phyllis Elton said to Gale Howard,
“wouldn’t you think they would have a more
modern bus? This thing might scare new students.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The driver frowned on her with all the disgust
possible to his wrinkled features.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Lizzie, here, has belonged to the college since
she was new. She’s good enough for you yet. Even
the new Dean can’t junk old Lizzie.” He patted
the steering wheel with all the affection and
prized possessiveness of a loving father.</p>

<p class='c008'>“New Dean?” Gale questioned. “Isn’t Professor
Harris the Dean any more?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nope,” the driver said. “Professor Harris resigned
an’ this new one come up here about three
weeks ago. She’s been tryin’ to make changes we
old ones don’t like.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The girls exchanged glances. They had heard
so much about Professor Harris and her rule at
Briarhurst. The Dean had been much beloved by
the girls. The prospect of a new régime at the
college did not particularly appeal to them.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s she like—the new Dean?” Janet
asked interestedly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Young and purty,” the sour old man said
grudgingly. “But she got no business tryin’ to
change things that been goin’ on all right for
thirty years. She won’t stay long,” he added
darkly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why won’t she stay?” Phyllis wanted to
know.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The old ones don’t like her,” he said firmly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“By ‘the old ones’ I take it you mean the
teachers and other members of the faculty,” Gale
said.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s right,” he agreed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What has she done to make them dislike
her?” Janet inquired.</p>

<p class='c008'>The man shook his head. “We don’t aim to
make this a modern institooshun. She has newfangled
notions about a new bus and sports for
the young ladies. We old ones ain’t goin’ to stand
for it,” he repeated firmly. Evidently he considered
himself an important part of the college
personnel.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The idea about a new bus is enough to prejudice
him,” Carol laughed to Janet. “Whoops!”
She made a wild lunge for her handbag as the
bus navigated a deep rut with a series of protesting
groans from the framework. “However, it is
enough to put me on her side. If she wants a new
bus I am for the new Dean!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The bus halted first in front of the registrar’s
office and the girls were assigned to their prospective
quarters. Because of crowded conditions
only Phyllis and Gale were fortunate enough to
win a room in the sorority house of Omega Chi,
and this was only through the efforts of their
former High School teacher. The other four
girls were assigned to the dormitory house on the
east lawn of the campus. At first the separation
rather put a damper on their spirits.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You might get into the sorority house next
year,” consoled Phyllis.</p>

<p class='c008'>“As it is,” Janet commented, “we will leave
you two to face the dragons of the sorority by
yourselves.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The next stop of the bus was to let Gale and
Phyllis off in front of the Omega Chi Sorority
house. They surveyed their future home interestedly
while standing in the midst of their baggage
which the driver had dumped unceremoniously
at their feet. The bus rattled away and the
girls exchanged glances.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We might as well go in,” Phyllis said finally.</p>

<p class='c008'>Several girls were on the veranda and these
viewed with interest the new arrivals.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We might as well,” Gale agreed with a sigh.
With a traveling bag in either hand she followed
Phyllis up the steps and into the building that
was to be their home for the next four years.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch02' class='c009'><i>Chapter II</i><br /> <br />A RESCUE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“I am not going to like it!” Janet announced
firmly when she met Phyllis and Gale on the
campus the next morning after breakfast.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You are lucky so far,” Phyllis told her. “The
upper classmen in the dormitories haven’t come
back for the term yet. We have some of the
sorority girls already in the house and do we get
looked over!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where is Carol?” Gale inquired.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Gone to get our tennis racquets,” Janet replied.
“We are going to take advantage of the
empty courts now before the upper classmen get
here.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll come along and watch,” Phyllis offered
magnanimously.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I want to take a walk and explore,” Gale informed
them. “I’ll see you at luncheon, Phyl.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Classes would not begin for three days yet, but
the girls had timed their arrival at Briarhurst
for days ahead to become acquainted with the
general position of their classes and the dormitories.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale headed in the direction of the lake that
lay on the western border of the campus. There
had been erected diving boards for the students
and canoes were anchored to the shore. Gale
watched for several minutes the cavortings of the
gay young girls who frolicked in the water, and
then continued with her stroll.</p>

<p class='c008'>Readers of The Adventure Girls at K Bar O
and The Adventure Girls in the Air are already
familiar with the six girls from the little town of
Marchton. Old friends already know of the desire
of the girls to attend Briarhurst College and
of the difficulties along that line experienced by
Phyllis Elton. Now it seemed their dreams were
in a fair way of being fulfilled. All of them, even
Phyllis, were actually present at the college and
starting out on an entirely new branch of life.
They were prepared to study hard and also prepared
to face the fun and trials of college life.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the grassy bank beneath a low-hanging
willow tree Gale sat down to view the water and
to think.</p>

<p class='c008'>Last night they had been met at the door by a
welcoming committee of two Juniors. She remembered
her own and Phyllis’ surprise at the odd
things which they saw on their journey to their
room on the third floor.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some delightful soul had christened the staircase
the “Golden Stairs,” but whether they led
to heaven or not the girls had not yet discovered.
On the landing of the second floor was a huge
poster which might have been the street sign for
a Boulevard proclaiming “Senior Avenue.” On
each floor the corridor was named and some of
the rooms themselves had names.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phyllis and Gale found themselves in “Sunshine
Alley” but there was no name tacked upon
their door.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How come?” Phyllis wanted to know.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You have to do something to deserve a name.
Then a special committee of sorority girls gets
together and selects one for you. For instance,
next door to you, you have the champion swimming
team of last year’s Freshman class. Their
room is named ‘Mermaid Mansion.’ Get the
idea?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Also farther up the hall is ‘Harmony
Heaven,’” the other upper classman informed
them. “That was so named because the girls there
are forever quarreling. The name anything but
fits them.”</p>

<p class='c008'>It was a little confusing to Gale and Phyllis.
They could not immediately adapt the terms for
the different floors and rooms in the house. At
dinner when someone asked them what floor they
were on, they innocently said “Third,” and were
made to run around the table three times for not
using the correct title “Sunshine Alley.”</p>

<p class='c008'>For the most part, though, the girls were
friendly. The two were shown about with due
ceremony and the rules carefully explained. The
house mother, Mrs. Grayson, who had charge of
the building was most courteous and the girls
immediately liked her. Next they met the sorority
president, Adele Stevens. They were at once taken
under her wing.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale dangled the end of a willow branch in the
swirling lake water. The water at this point was
flowing rapidly toward a waterfall where it joined
a rushing river and went on to the sea.</p>

<p class='c008'>This afternoon she had an appointment with
the President of the college and then one with the
Dean. It was customary for all new students to
be thus interviewed, but Gale wondered if they
all felt as nervous as she. She had a strong curiosity
and yet a reluctance to meet the new Dean.
She wanted to see the new authority because the
girls had talked about her so much at dinner last
night. It seemed the Seniors all sympathized
with the bus driver. They were prepared to
strongly oppose any new policies installed by
Dean Travis. From what Gale and Phyllis had
heard, the new Dean’s policies would better
things on the campus. At least they appealed
favorably to the new Freshmen. Certainly there
could be nothing wrong in wanting new laboratories
for the Chemistry classes, a new organ for
the chapel, stables and horses to teach the girls
riding and a few other such things. Why the
older students were so set against them Phyllis
and Gale could not understand. However, they
both agreed, in the privacy of their room, to take
neither side until they knew more about things.
At any rate, they were only Freshmen and Freshmen
were to be seen, not heard.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale was about to turn back to the campus to
meet Phyllis for luncheon at the sorority house
when she halted. Had that been a voice calling?
Faintly another call came across the water. Parting
the low thick branches of the willow tree, Gale
looked across the lake.</p>

<p class='c008'>A canoe was drifting down the center of the
lake. It was going more swiftly every moment,
caught in the rush of waters leaping on toward
the waterfall at the other end. In the canoe was
a figure, waving frantically to the shore.</p>

<p class='c008'>Either the canoeist had lost her oars or she was
so panic-stricken at being caught in the swirling
waters that she could not think conclusively or
quickly enough to save herself.</p>

<p class='c008'>A tree branch had been broken from a tree in
a recent storm and now it, too, swirled around in
the lake waters. Gale watched breathlessly while
the branch bore down on the canoe. She was
helpless to aid even though the onslaught would
probably upset the canoe. But such was not the
case. Instead of toppling the canoe over the boat
became entangled in the wet leaves still clinging
to the wood and so, locked together, the two
moved toward the waterfall.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale started to run swiftly back to where, in
the calmer waters, the college girls had been
swimming. Someone must rescue that woman in
the canoe. Perhaps there would be a motor boat
at the diving boards. Another canoe would not
be much help. Gale kept close to the shore as she
ran, always keeping in view of the canoe. Once
she stopped to wave to the tragic figure being
swept to destruction. She saw an answering wave
and heard a call, but she could not distinguish
the words.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fortunately she did not have to run all the way
back to the swimmers. Hidden close to the mossy
bank in a thick growth of shrubbery along the
shore was a motor boat. Gale found it with a sense
of immeasurable relief. With trembling fingers
she untied the anchor rope and jumped into the
boat. How thankful she was that she had had
ample experience with motor boats back in
Marchton! It stood her in good stead now. The
motor responded promptly and she turned the
nose of the boat out into the lake. She drew speed
from the boat and wondered what the owner
might say.</p>

<p class='c008'>The canoe, still tangled with the dead tree
branch, was even closer to the tumbling waters
going over the waterfall. Gale was glad the motor
boat was a large, sturdy affair. With its powerful
motor working rhythmically it should be able to
withstand the pull of those rushing waters.</p>

<p class='c008'>Flinging a heavy spray back over Gale the
boat sped eagerly through the water. It rapidly
closed the distance between the drifting canoe
and the would-be rescuer. Almost upon the canoe
Gale tried to think of the best means of getting
the woman safely aboard the motor boat. She
certainly could not be transferred from the canoe
in the middle of the water. Therefore, the best
procedure would be to tow the canoe to shore.
But first the tree branch must be disposed of. It
might drag both the canoe and the motor boat to
the falls.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hang on,” Gale shouted to the figure in the
canoe, “we’ll make the shore all right.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She ran the motor boat as close as she could
to the canoe. The swell of water threatened to
upset the smaller craft. Gale shut the motor off.
The boat was immediately swept into the current.
Grasping a long, heavy boat hook which she
found lying on the deck, Gale stepped onto the
closed cabinet-like doors which sheltered the engine.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Go back—you’ll be killed!” the other figure
implored.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale sent the woman a reassuring smile. She
had done such crazy stunts on Bruce Latimer’s
boat back in Marchton. Now she felt no fear at
all for herself, only a fear that she might not be
able to push the tree branch far enough away to
loosen the canoe. She tied one end of a coil of
rope to the anchor bolt on the motor boat and
threw it toward the canoe. It fell directly across
the small craft. The canoeist grasped it and made
it secure.</p>

<p class='c008'>Cautiously Gale worked herself farther out to
the bow of the boat. She had only a few seconds
now in which to loosen the tree branch and restart
the motor to save them both. At the first
thrust of the boat hook Gale nearly toppled herself
into the water. She heard a muffled cry from
the woman in the canoe. She regained her posture.
She could never do it standing upright. Therefore,
she lay down flat on her stomach on the boat.
That gave her a freer use of her right arm and
less chance of losing her balance. A gigantic push
and the branch swept away from the canoe and
onward to the destruction of the falls.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale lost no time in making her way back to
start the motor. Luckily it started with the first
try and the motor boat pulled clear of the swirling
waters, dragging behind it the canoe.</p>

<p class='c008'>Once on shore Gale tied the motor boat securely
to its former position and helped the slender
figure from the canoe. The canoeist was a
woman older than Gale, but Gale felt immediately
that they could be firm friends. She liked
the other’s frank smile and clear gray eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You are a brave girl!” the woman said when
she was safe and her first words of thanks were
over. “I might be over the falls now if it were
not for you,” she shuddered.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale smiled. “It was a lucky thing someone
was here. What happened? Did you go out without
any oars?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know better than to do that,” the woman
said. “I was sitting in the canoe farther up along
the shore, reading. I often do that. I had no desire
to go out on the lake so I left the oars on
shore while the boat remained anchored. I must
have fallen asleep. The next thing I knew I awoke
and I was in the middle of the lake, caught in the
rapids.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale looked at the boat and noted the short
bit of rope dangling from its stern.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It rather looks as though that rope was cut,”
she said, noting the sharpness of its edge as
though a knife had severed it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You must never mention that to anyone,” the
other said quickly. “Promise me you will never
speak such a thought!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale laughed. “Of course—but why shouldn’t
I?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I can’t explain now, but there is a very good
reason.” She held out her hand. “I would like to
say thank you again. Will you come to see me
this afternoon?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale put her hand into the one offered her. “I’m
sorry,” she said regretfully. “You see I am new
at the college and I have an appointment with
the Dean.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A whimsical light came into the gray eyes.
“You don’t seem very enthusiastic.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m not,” Gale confessed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Have you been listening to the upper classmen?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“A little,” Gale said. “But it isn’t that. I’m not
prejudiced against her. She may be perfectly all
right—it is only that—I’m a little nervous. I
guess all Freshmen are. I hope she is nicer than
what I hear about her.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The other woman laughed. “I hope you find
her so. Now I——”</p>

<p class='c008'>The patter of running feet interrupted her and
a group of girls burst upon them.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We saw what happened from up the shore,”
one gasped. “Are you all right, Dean Travis?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dean Travis! Gale felt the world whirling
around her. This was the new Dean!</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am quite all right, thank you,” the Dean
was saying composedly.</p>

<p class='c008'>A second later she was gone and the other girls
with her. Gale was alone and she sank down dejectedly
on a tree trunk. For a long time she sat
there staring out over the water. Finally she
made her way slowly back to the sorority house
where Phyllis was waiting for her.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c008'>That afternoon Gale went to the office of the
Dean. If she had been nervous this morning before
she met the Dean she was ten times more so
now. To think of the things she had said! They
made her cheeks burn now. How could she have
talked so and to the Dean! She sat on the hard
outer office chair and thought of all the places
she would rather be. She thought of Phyllis and
Madge and Valerie swimming in the lake. She
thought of Janet and Carol again playing tennis.
How she longed to be with them. How she longed
to be anywhere where she did not have to face
the Dean!</p>

<p class='c008'>“You may go in, Miss Howard,” the secretary
said.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale stood up and took a deep breath. She
covered the distance into the office in little less
than a run. She felt she had to go as quickly as
possible before she turned and fled out of sheer
panic.</p>

<p class='c008'>There was another woman with Dean Travis,
a woman with brown curly hair and a flashing,
whimsical smile, absurdly young to be the school
physician, but such Gale found her to be when
they were introduced. She stayed to talk with
Gale and the Dean for several minutes and the
Freshman felt all her self-consciousness and
timidity melting away before the warmth of the
Doctor’s smile. However, when the Doctor had
gone and the Dean was seated behind her desk,
Gale in the chair before her, the girl felt her discomfiture
returning. After all, this woman was
the Dean and she had talked to her and treated
her much as she might have Phyllis or Valerie.
Hereafter she must remember to treat the Dean
with the respect and deference required by the
head of the girls’ college.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is your room at the Omega Chi Sorority house
satisfactory?” the Dean was asking pleasantly.
She tapped a white envelope before her. “I have
had a long letter from your former High School
teacher, Miss Relso.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Everything is perfect, thank you,” Gale said
politely.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Your roommate is your friend from home?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, yes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I hope you are going to like Briarhurst, Miss
Howard.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am sure I shall.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The girls are all pleasant, that is for the most
part. Of course there are some who are selfish and
like their own way, but one finds them in every
walk of life. Briarhurst tries to fit the girls to
take a definite place in the world, to help them
live the kind of life worth living. We don’t say
we fit you to immediately take charge of whatever
line of endeavor you go into when your four
years here are up. All we try to do is give you the
prime essentials for your life—courage, determination,
ambition, the desire to play fair and to
take gallantly whatever life offers you.” She
smiled. “What is the matter, Gale?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Matter?” Gale was surprised out of her respectful
silence.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You have been sitting there politely listening,
but I doubt if a word I’ve said has remained in
your memory,” the Dean said humorously.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I assure you, it has,” Gale said hastily.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Are you still nervous about meeting—the
Dean?” the older woman asked, rising and walking
around the desk to Gale’s side.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale also rose. “I’m sorry if I was rude this
morning,” she said in embarrassment. “I had no
idea——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That I was the Dean?” the other said. “Otherwise
you would have let the canoe drift over the
falls, is that it? I’m sorry, that was a terrible
thing to say,” she continued breathlessly. “Forgive
me.” She laid a hand lightly on Gale’s shoulder.
“This isn’t the type of interview I usually
have with a Freshman.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I gathered that much,” Gale smiled. She continued
after a while, rather hesitantly, “You
aren’t really worried about—about the things the
girls are saying, are you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No,” the Dean smiled, walking to the door
with Gale. “Not really worried. Goodbye, my
dear, and come to see me often—as a friend, if
not in my official capacity.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale stepped out into the world red with the
glow from the setting sun and thought what a
grand person Dean Travis was. She had a personality
that made one immediately want to be
the best sort of person one could. That she would
in a short time win all the girls over to her side,
Gale did not doubt. She was so pleasant, so easy
to approach, so interested in the girls, that they
could not resent her for any length of time no
matter how much they missed their former Dean.</p>

<p class='c008'>A hand touched her arm and she jumped in
surprise, so deep in thought had she been.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Did I frighten you?” a laughing voice asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>Doctor Norcot fell into step beside her. “I
waited for you,” she added with a look around.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale saw a few girls across the campus watching
her and the Doctor. She hoped they weren’t
the Adventure Girls. If such was the case, she
would be teased intolerably about already being
friends with two such important people as the
Dean and the Doctor.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wanted to ask you more about that cut
rope.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Cut rope?” Gale repeated, puzzled. “Oh, you
mean on the canoe.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes. Are you positive it was cut?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale nodded. “There couldn’t be any doubt
about it. You see it was just a new rope. That is,
the end that was left was new. It couldn’t have
worn through. The edge was straight and not at
all frayed. It had been cut,” she said firmly. “Did
Dean Travis tell you about it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes. You haven’t told anyone, have you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No,” Gale said in mystification. “But why
shouldn’t I? Anyone who looks at the canoe will
be sure to see it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Freshmen have enough on their minds without
adding other people’s troubles,” the Doctor
teased. “Good afternoon, Miss Howard.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Eyes grown stormy with indignation and then
calmer with humor, Gale watched her stride
across the campus and into the red brick building
which housed the infirmary and the Doctor’s
quarters.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What a nice, polite way of telling me to mind
my own business,” she laughed to herself. “But
just the same,” she added mischievously, “I won’t
mind it. I, too, would like to know why that rope
was cut so Dean Travis’ canoe would drift out
and be caught in the rapids.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She walked across the campus toward the sorority
house. The building was gray and ivy covered.
The sun’s last rays made the vine leaves
gleam silver and gold in turn. “Happiness
House!” She smiled. What a fitting name for the
place. Whoever had substituted such a name for
the intimate use of the girls had chosen it rightly
enough. There seemed to be nothing but peace,
contentment and utter harmony among the girls.
At least so far she and Phyllis had discovered
nothing else. Of course when the rest of the girls
arrived for the semester things might be different.</p>

<p class='c008'>She mounted the steps and entered the living
room. There were several girls there, gathered
about the piano. One held a ukulele and as Gale
went toward the staircase she started to sing:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“There was a happy young Freshman,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who rescued the Dean from the water,</div>
      <div class='line'>But alas and alack, now the Freshman is sad,</div>
      <div class='line'>Cause she did something she hadn’t oughter.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Gale laughed and ran lightly up the Golden
Stairs to Sunshine Alley. The rhyming was decidedly
bad in the girl’s song.</p>

<p class='c008'>Just as she reached the door to her room the
most blood-curdling yell came through the panels
that she had to pause and put her hands over
her ears. From all along the hall doors opened
and heads were poked out.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale turned the door knob and entered. Phyllis
was sitting on the bed convulsed with laughter.
Astride the footboard of her bed was another
girl, evidently the one who had given voice
to that shout because her mouth was still open.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What on earth——” Gale began.</p>

<p class='c008'>“My roommate,” Phyllis managed to gasp between
giggles.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Howdy!” The girl who was using the bed footboard
as a horse said, extending a brown hand.
“I’m Ricky Allen. I’m in the room across the
hall.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m glad to know you,” Gale said, laughing
in spite of herself, “but would you mind telling
me what that noise was just now?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Phyllis wiped the tears from her eyes. “Ricky
is from Wyoming and she was illustrating a cowboy
round-up whoop for me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>There was a heavy knock upon the door. Gale
opened it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who is being murdered?” Adele Stevens asked
calmly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale shook her head. “It was a mistake. It
seems only a cowboy war-whoop got loose. We
have it under control now,” she added.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the Sorority president was gone Ricky
grinned at the two girls.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Reckon I’m goin’ to like this place now I’ve
met you. I didn’t at first. I was lonesome for my
ranch and my horses.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I understand the new Dean plans to have stables
and horses installed to teach the girls riding,”
Gale said.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yipeeee!” Ricky greeted the news eagerly.
“That’ll be great. I’ve gotta tell my roommate
that!”</p>

<p class='c008'>She was gone with the same suddenness and
whirlwind speed that characterized all her
actions. Gale and Phyllis looked at one another
and burst out laughing.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch03' class='c009'><i>Chapter III</i><br /> <br />BELL NIGHT</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Classes started and with them the Freshmen’s
troubles. New acquaintances, new
scenes, new studies, and new instructors came
with such rapidity that the girls were dizzy with
it all. Carol and Janet were in the same dormitory
building as Valerie and Madge. Consequently
their close friendship was by no means
interrupted. Gale and Phyllis went to see their
friends quite often. When they were in their own
room they found that Ricky Allen and her roommate
joined them frequently. The girls were fast
becoming friends.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ulrich Allen, Ricky to her friends, was a
breezy, friendly girl from the West and there was
not a soul in the class who did not know all about
her. Her roommate was a quiet, sweet young girl
from Georgia. Ricky took pains to see to it that
everyone should know about her, too.</p>

<p class='c008'>Janet declared that Ricky was as clear and as
unassuming as the country from which she came.
Nevertheless, Janet and Ricky could be seen with
heads close together very often, planning mischief
or laughing over their latest bit of gossip.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale, since the afternoon she had rescued the
Dean from the lake, had seen the older woman
only once. On that occasion the Dean walked
across the campus to the library with her. It was
something she would take care not to let happen
again, she told herself. It seemed that girls from
the sorority house had seen her. The upper classmen
looked with the utmost distaste upon such
familiarity. They saw to it that Gale should regret
such friendliness with the head of the institution.
She was teased unmercifully and chided
and scoffed at upon every occasion. Most of the
girls did it in fun, the fun that upper classmen
usually have with a Freshman, but one girl in
particular seemed to personally resent Gale.</p>

<p class='c008'>Marcia Marlette had been one of the very last
Juniors to arrive for the semester. She lived in
Penthouse Row, the fourth floor, in a room directly
over Gale and Phyllis. She had heard the
story of Gale and the Dean. She had seen for
herself that the Dean did smile and stop to talk
with Gale when such occasions presented themselves.
She was one of the girls who was voluble
in her protestations against the new Dean. She
had been favored and especially privileged the
two terms before. Now that there was a new Dean
and a new regime her privileges were swept away.
She was to be no more favored than any other
girl. That didn’t please Marcia, and since she
couldn’t very well spite the Dean she decided to
torture Gale—supposedly a close friend of Dean
Travis.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale bore the girls’ teasing silently, in amused
indifference. She didn’t mind the stunts she and
Phyllis had to perform to appease their sorority
sisters, but from the minute Marcia Marlette
appeared on the campus things were different.
Gale could bear the other girls’ teasing, their
songs, their sly pointed remarks, but she couldn’t
and wouldn’t stand for it from Marcia.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I tell you, Phyl,” Gale said stormily, flinging
her books onto her desk, “I won’t stand for it.
I’ll—I’ll tell Dean Travis.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Phyllis smiled patiently. “Can’t do that, Gale.
We’ve got to take it. Our turn will come.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know,” Gale said. She flung herself upon the
bed and glared at the ceiling. “But I will blow up
and explode if Marcia Marlette doesn’t stay away
from me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What has she been doing now?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Met me after Chemistry class and walked to
the house with me—making nasty remarks about
the Dean all the while. I’ll—I’ll slap her face
some day,” Gale threatened.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Whoa, there,” Ricky Allen murmured, sticking
her head in at the open door. “Who is gonna
slap who?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Are we missing anything?” added Gloria
Manson.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale sat up and laughed. “I am boiling over
with suppressed wrath.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Only it isn’t suppressed any more,” Phyllis
murmured. “Girls, you see before you a volcano
about to erupt.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Go ahead and erupt,” Ricky invited, settling
herself comfortably on Phyllis’ bed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What happened?” Gloria asked sympathetically.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale sat on the window sill and took a deep
breath of the autumn air. “That awful Junior
has been pestering me again. I suppose it is only
a matter of months before I become immune to
it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That awful Junior heard what you said,” a
voice declared nastily.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale put her head out the window and looked
up. Marcia Marlette was leaning out her window
and grinning with exasperating superiority.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Perhaps you would like to say it directly to
me,” she invited.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale was not lacking in courage and her anger
now made her more daring.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Certainly I’ll say it,” she answered firmly. “I
said you were pestering me again. So what?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The Junior’s face was more irritating.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Freshmen are supposed to be polite to upper
classmen—especially sorority sisters. Rebellion
will cost you a month’s special privileges.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But that isn’t fair!” Gale cried indignantly.
“I didn’t do anything—wait, Marcia——”</p>

<p class='c008'>But the Junior had disappeared into her room.
Gale swung about and confronted the others. She
strode to the door, but Phyllis preceded her. With
her back against the door Phyllis asked:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where are you going?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Up to Marcia’s room,” Gale said hotly. “I’m
going to tell her a few things! Things I’ve been
aching to say ever since I first saw her. I’m going——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You are going to stay right here,” Phyllis said
calmly. “Sit down, Gale, and get hold of your
temper again. I never saw you so fiery. I don’t
know what Marcia might have done or said, but
I’ll wager it was only to make you angry. She
wants you to do something like this. You will
only injure yourself in the end.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ignore Marcia,” Ricky advised.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale submitted reluctantly to their advice. She
knew it was wiser to ignore Marcia’s slights and
cutting remarks, but just the same she was still
angry. Her resentment was growing deeper every
hour. Oh, she had taken instant dislikes to people
before, but she had never felt so unreasonably,
so thoroughly hateful toward another girl. The
minute she had seen Marcia stroll into the dining
room on the night of the latter’s arrival Gale
could have told Phyllis she wouldn’t like her. Before
Marcia ever said a word to her, Gale felt
resentment burning within her. She didn’t know
why. Then, when Marcia started to annoy her
and Phyllis, Gale more than ever disliked the
Junior. So far she had been successful in hiding
it. She avoided all possible contact with Marcia,
but after all they were bound to meet sometimes.
They sat at the same table at dinner, and it was
there Marcia was worst of all. Gale and Phyllis
accepted everything she said with a slight smile
and silence. That only seemed to make matters
more difficult. Marcia was deliberately picking
an open quarrel and the upper classmen fully realized
the position of the Freshmen. Their attitude
softened somewhat and for that the girls were
grateful. But it still did not solve the question of
Marcia.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Are you going out for hockey?” Gloria asked,
idly thumbing Gale’s Chemistry book.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sure,” Ricky declared, “aren’t we, Phyl?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am,” Phyllis said. “How about you, Gale?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“For class hockey? The first meeting is tomorrow
afternoon.” With difficulty Gale turned her
attention to other things.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We only have five minutes before dinner,”
Gloria announced next.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ricky dragged herself upright. “Shall we go
downstairs and wait?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Phyllis flung a hasty glance at Gale. If they
went downstairs now Marcia would most likely
be there. It would be bad enough at dinner with
her sitting across from them.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No,” Phyllis said vaguely, “I want to brush
my hair and——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You had better hurry,” Gale murmured.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phyllis remained close to Gale when they descended
the stairs behind Ricky and Gloria. The
girls were moving toward the dining room. Phyllis
looked hastily around for Marcia. She was not
in sight. When Phyllis slipped into her seat beside
Gale she looked across the table. Marcia’s
chair was empty.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where’s Marcia?” she murmured to the girl
on her other side.</p>

<p class='c008'>“She has permission to eat at the West Campus
Dormitory,” was the answer.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phyllis sighed with relief. She did not want to
see a quarrel between Gale and Marcia. It would
mean only trouble for Gale. Marcia was used to
having her own way, girls naturally catered to
her. She would not stand to be ignored by a
Freshman. That Gale should be friends with the
Dean was all the more reason for Marcia to resent
her. Last year Marcia had been close to the
old Dean. Marcia had had special privileges. She
had not been tied to the college grounds to observe
the rules as the other girls had. But now
Dean Travis did not grant Marcia those special
privileges. Phyllis believed that was all that
stood between the Dean and popularity with some
girls. A lot of the girls wanted special privileges
and the Dean did not grant them. Phyllis could
not help but admire the Dean for treating all the
girls exactly the same. There would be even more
dissatisfaction if some girls were allowed to do
things and others weren’t.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phyllis, upon learning that Gale and Marcia
would not possibly meet tonight and quarrel, was
gay with relief.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know how you feel,” Gale murmured to her
friend. “But you really shouldn’t have worried,
Phyl. I would never make a scene here—before
all the others.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Are you a mind reader? How did you know
what I was thinking?” Phyllis demanded.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale laughed. “You are an open book to me,”
she giggled.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phyllis sighed. “Woe is me! Nothing is a secret
any more.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The girls did not linger with the others long
after dinner. They went to their room, Phyllis to
read and Gale to write letters. She owed one to
her parents, one to Miss Relso, who was still taking
an interest in their school life, and one to
Brent Stockton. The one to Brent was the longest
and well it should be. Gale did not often see
the young aviator with whom she was so much in
love, but their letters were long and frequent and
filled with many pictures.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Send Brent my love,” Phyllis told her as she
struggled into her pajamas. “Doesn’t that make
you jealous?” she wanted to know teasingly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No,” Gale said promptly. “I even sent him a
picture of you—and me,” she added.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Foiled!” Phyllis murmured, smothering a
yawn in the pillow, “Aren’t you ever going to
bed?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Lights-out bell hasn’t rung yet,” Gale reminded
her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You can go to bed anyway,” Phyllis informed
her. “The Dean won’t mind.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Go to sleep,” Gale laughed.</p>

<p class='c008'>The moonlight came into the room with illuminating
brilliance. The girls slept peacefully,
sweetly dreaming delightful dreams. The campus
was still with the peace of an autumn night. The
sorority house was dark. It was as if another
world of glorious peace and accord had opened
where previously had been the trill of voices and
patter of running feet. Now nothing moved but
the silent clouds over the moon and the gentle
sifting of leaves in the wind.</p>

<p class='c008'>But suddenly the night was shattered by a bell,
a bell riotous and loud, somewhere close to the
ear of the sleeping Phyllis. She sprang out of bed
with a shriek. Gale sat up and put her hands over
her ears. Another bell joined the first and together
their voices made a clatter that disturbed
sleepers all over the building. Phyllis dashed
wildly about, seeking the cause of the clatter. She
found an alarm clock under the bed, whose bell
was the cause of the initial outburst. She turned
it off while Gale sought the second bell. But Gale
had no sooner found the clock hidden in her suitcase
than another bell broke forth and another
and another. The place was alive with bells, each
louder and more shrill than the one before.</p>

<p class='c008'>The girls sat in the center of the floor and
looked helplessly at one another.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let ’em ring,” Phyllis advised.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s all we can do,” Gale conceded laughingly.
“I wonder whose idea this was?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I said——” Gale began to repeat patiently,
but it was no use. Phyllis could not hear her
above the clatter. It seemed a million bells were
ringing. Never had the girls heard such a varied
assortment of bell sounds.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gradually the bells began to stop. Gently the
tinkling died out and the girls climbed back into
bed. But they were no sooner settled than the
loudest and most disturbing gong of all started.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sounds like a fire alarm,” Phyllis shouted.</p>

<p class='c008'>She was hastily rummaging in her closet. Her
search disclosed a big alarm clock hidden in a hat
box. She brought it out.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How do you shut it off?” she yelled to Gale.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale shook her head, laughing. The two tried
everything, but the most effective was stuffing
the clock under two pillows. That softened its
siren shriek somewhat.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What a night!” Phyllis groaned, as she
climbed back into bed. She very slowly and carefully
stuffed cotton in her ears. “I am going to
sleep the rest of the night even if the roof caves
in!” she prophesied.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What was going on in your room last night?”
Ricky demanded the next morning when she paid
them a visit before breakfast.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Somebody hid a hundred alarm clocks in here
to scare us,” Phyllis explained, crawling from
under Gale’s bed. She had discovered two more
clocks.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Going to start a store?” Gloria asked, motioning
to the array of clocks standing on Phyllis’
desk.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phyllis shook her head. She opened the door
and pushed a chair out into the hall. On it she set
all the clocks. In front of them she put a sign
“To be claimed,” and then they all went down to
breakfast.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look!” Ricky pointed dramatically to the
chair when they returned to get their books for
classes.</p>

<p class='c008'>The chair was empty. The clocks were all gone.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch04' class='c009'><i>Chapter IV</i><br /> <br />TROUBLE AHEAD</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Gale tucked her books under her arm and
started down the steps of Happiness House.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Gale! Wait!” Adele Stevens called and fell
into step beside her. “Even Seniors go to classes
sometimes,” she smiled. “Nice morning, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Very,” Gale agreed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Last night was a nice night, too,” the Senior
said, with twinkling eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale laughed. “Yes. The sound of a million
bells always lends enchantment to an autumn
night.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Adele laughed, too. “You and Phyllis have been
good sports, Gale. Don’t think we haven’t noticed
it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ve gotten fun out of it, too,” Gale said.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You are the kind of girls we want in Happiness
House,” the Senior declared. “But,” she
frowned, “Gale, we are sorry for some
things——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Freshmen expect a lot,” Gale said, smiling.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I mean—such as Marcia Marlette.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh.” Gale looked across the campus, letting
her eyes dwell on the red and golden brown of the
leaves stirring in the breeze.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Gale, don’t ever think that the things she does
have the approval of the whole sorority,” Adele
continued seriously. “She is one of our members,
true. She was elected to our house when she was
a Freshman. Now we can’t exactly put her out—it
wouldn’t be the nice thing to do and she won’t
quit of her own accord. She knows we don’t like
what she has been doing lately. Our sorority
house is Happiness House. We want to keep it
that. We don’t want quarrels or bickering. We
want friendship between the girls, friendship that
lasts much longer than our college days. Do you
see what I mean?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale nodded. “I think so.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, I leave you here. Remember, Gale, you
and Phyllis are the sort of girls we want in Happiness
House—and we hope you want to stay
there.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale watched the Senior enter the Hall where
she was to attend her class. Slowly Gale strolled
along to her own class. She liked Adele Stevens.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Was our noble president giving you some good
advice?” a voice asked dryly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale merely glanced at Marcia Marlette as the
girl walked beside her. “Yes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thought so. I suppose you think she is just
the noblest person,” Marcia laughed. “Freshmen
always take to Adele. They plan to be like
her, but then Freshmen are idealistic and——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ve got to go,” Gale said, and hastily ran up
and into the nearest building. Inside she stood in
the shadows until Marcia had turned away and
was almost out of sight. Then she came out and
went on more peacefully to her own class.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale was finding college life more and more interesting.
She did want to make something of her
life and she seriously thought of studying medicine.
She didn’t want to be a nurse—rather a doctor.
The other girls were inclined to treat such
ambition with lightness. They didn’t think much
of women doctors, but Gale was still determined.
Whether she would achieve her doctor’s degree
was dim in the future, but at least she had chosen
to take the pre-medical course at college. She figured
that was a step in the right direction.</p>

<p class='c008'>Her favorite subject right now was Chemistry.
She found Professor Lukens, the Chemistry
teacher, willing to answer all and any questions.
Often she lingered after classes for a further talk
or experiment. On one occasion Doctor Norcot
was there and the three of them had a most interesting
talk until the Dean and Professor Powell,
assistant Chemistry teacher, arrived.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I came for you,” the Dean said to the Doctor.
“My secretary was suddenly taken ill. She is in
the infirmary and the nurse advised calling you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll come at once,” the Doctor said.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale, too, gathered up her books and made her
way to the door. There the Dean joined her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Gale, I haven’t seen you for a week or more.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No,” Gale agreed.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Freshman went down the stairs with the
Dean and the Doctor. They stopped on the steps
outside to talk before separating. Gale was talking
to the Dean when the Doctor suddenly pushed
them roughly to one side.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look out!” she shouted.</p>

<p class='c008'>There was a tinkle of glass and a dark stain
spread on the stone steps at their feet. The three
bent over it before the Doctor whirled and ran
into the building.</p>

<p class='c008'>“A test tube of acid!” Gale cried in amazement.
“I wonder how that came to fall out the
window?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Fall? Perhaps it was thrown,” the Dean murmured,
looking up at the windows to the Chemistry
room which fronted on the campus.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thrown!” Gale gasped. “But if that had hit
one of us—the way acid burns we might have
been scarred for life! No one would do such a
thing!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No,” the Dean agreed unenthusiastically, “no
one would do such a thing.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale looked at her strangely. The Dean was
white, whether with fear or anger, Gale did not
know. From the Dean, Gale looked at the shattered
glass and up at the window. Doctor Norcot
was leaning out, looking directly down at them.
She disappeared and a few minutes later rejoined
them on the campus. Her face was sternly set
and she answered the Dean’s questioning glance
with a shake of her head.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There was no one in the room—and the test
tubes and materials are all locked in the closet.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The Dean flashed a glance at Gale, The Doctor
smiled in understanding.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Shall we go on to the infirmary now?” she
asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>A few minutes later Gale was walking across
the campus toward the field in back of the tennis
courts where the Freshman class was practicing
hockey. So deeply in thought was she that she
passed several girls from the sorority house without
recognizing them at all. That night she talked
the whole affair over with Phyllis.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you think the Dean actually suspects that
the acid was thrown?” Phyllis asked in consternation.
“That is an awful thing for anybody to
do!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale frowned. “That is what she said. Remember,
too, that somebody cut her canoe adrift and
she was almost caught in the rapids.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It would seem somebody doesn’t like the new
Dean,” Phyllis murmured. “Do you know what
was wrong with her secretary?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale shook her head. “No, but I am going to
find out. I have a hunch that the three incidents
are tied together in some way.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ah! Mystery at Briarhurst!” Phyllis said
gayly. “But both things might have been accidental,
you know.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t think so,” Gale said firmly. “A rope
doesn’t cut itself and secondly, a test tube of acid
doesn’t walk from a locked closet and fall out the
window.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then you think someone is really trying to
injure the Dean?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It looks like it,” Gale said. She crossed to the
window. Her studies were forgotten, the open text
book on her desk did not exist. “Heavenly night,
Phyl.”</p>

<p class='c008'>From the campus below floated up a chorus of
friendly voices. The Seniors were singing their
sorority song:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Secure in love and laughter,</div>
      <div class='line'>Our voices blend on high,</div>
      <div class='line'>We link our hands in friendship,</div>
      <div class='line'>The girls of Omega Chi.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“So far so good,” Phyllis said, putting her arm
about Gale and leaning with her on the window
sill.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What? The song?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, I mean us. We’ve been here three weeks
now and like it more every day. At least I do,”
she added.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let’s go and see Janet and Carol,” proposed
Gale mischievously.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is study hour,” Phyllis returned. “Freshmen
are supposed to slave away over their books.
We are to remain indoors.” She continued with
twinkling eyes, “How shall we get out? By the
back door?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale switched out the light. On tiptoe the girls
went to the rear stairs. With the silence of
shadows they descended to the ground. Once outside
they stood for several minutes in the shadows
of the building, waiting for the Seniors to disappear
from view. Finally they were safely away
from the sorority house. Quickly they ran to the
dormitory building where Janet and Carol were
housed. Once there, another problem presented
itself.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How’ll we get in?” Phyllis wanted to know.</p>

<p class='c008'>There were two Juniors sitting on the steps in
front of the building so that was closed to them.
Gale pointed suggestively to a trellis from which
only lately the dried vines had been cut to leave
room for new growth in the spring.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Acrobats, eh?” Phyllis giggled. “Well, why
not? We used to climb ropes in gym at High
School. I guess we can climb that to the second
floor. It is a good thing they don’t live on the
fourth,” she added in a stage whisper as she rested
halfway to their goal.</p>

<p class='c008'>Carol and Janet were bent over their books.
Out of the corner of her eye Carol saw a head
slowly appearing at the open window.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Help! Burglars!” she shrieked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Shshsh,” Phyllis laughed. “It is only us.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Such hospitality,” Gale said disgustedly,
climbing into the room after Phyllis. “You should
have a stepladder at least for your callers.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Our callers don’t usually enter through the
window,” Janet returned. “Am I glad to see you!
I was about to burst with all the biology I am
cramming into my head.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t see how she does it,” added Carol
lightly. “Bugs, bugs——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Speaking of bugs,” Janet put in, “when does
the Freshman team play the Sophomores in
hockey?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Next week,” Phyllis answered.</p>

<p class='c008'>Noiselessly the door opened. Valerie and
Madge stole into the room.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ah, a family reunion,” Janet beamed. “We
will have to celebrate. Carol, get the chocolate.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We have a box of cookies in our room,” added
Madge generously.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ah, perhaps we had better go to your room,”
Carol declared brightly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll bring them here,” Madge offered.</p>

<p class='c008'>Neither the hot chocolate nor the cookies lasted
very long when once the six girls set seriously
about the task of devouring them.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You know,” Janet said, munching the icing
off her cookie before she ate the rest of it, “I
heard that one of the Chemistry teachers is sending
the Dean candy and flowers.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mmmmm,” Carol hummed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Romantic idiots!” Madge called them. “Because
the Dean is young and good looking you
think there is a romance.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, why not? Even college professors aren’t
immune to it. Look at Gale——” Janet offered
mischievously. “Even she was conquered by a
birdman.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That isn’t all about the Dean,” Valerie said
in a whisper and the others leaned forward in interest.
“I heard someone is trying to murder her—or
something.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What do you mean?” Gale asked tensely.
“Tell us!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I heard,” Valerie said, “that her house was
set afire yesterday.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What?” Both Phyllis and Gale were on the
edge of their chairs with renewed interest.
“How?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No one knows,” Valerie replied. “The maid
saw the curtains blazing in the library. She called
the caretaker and he ripped them down and
stamped the fire out. There was nothing they
could have caught fire from. It must have been
done deliberately.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But who?” Carol scoffed. “Why?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Things like that aren’t done,” Janet added.
She looked at Phyllis and Gale. “You two look as
though you actually believed it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Tell them what you know, Gale,” Phyllis advised.
“But,” she added, “you mustn’t go around
telling the other girls. We can’t prove anything—it
is only what we think.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ll be as mum as mice,” Carol promised.
“If we have been missing anything, tell us!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale told them of the things she had discovered
and of the things she suspected. The other
girls were astounded.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We will have to appoint ourselves solvers of
the mystery,” Carol suggested.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We are the best mystery-solvers at Briarhurst,”
added Janet. “But where do we begin?
There aren’t any clues or anyone to suspect.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good detectives find those things,” Madge informed
her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But for goodness sake,” cautioned Phyllis,
“be careful about it. Dean Travis might not like
our bothering with her affairs. After all, it isn’t
our business, you know.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ll make it our business,” Gale proposed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And it might mean adventures for us,” added
Valerie.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We have been falling rather low on adventures,”
commented Janet. “Things have been too
quiet. We must stir something up.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We will do that, never fear,” prophesied
Carol.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And now we have to go back to the sorority
house,” Phyllis said, consulting Janet’s desk
clock. “Lights-out bell rang twenty minutes
ago.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Perhaps we can use the front door instead of
the window this time,” suggested Phyllis.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale and her friend cautiously descended to
the campus and there took a deep breath of relief.
They had gotten out of the dormitory house
without detection, but now to get back into their
own room!</p>

<p class='c008'>They sped across the campus, keeping in the
shadows. Almost at the very door of the sorority
house they were forced to halt.
Crouching<a id='crouching'/> in the shadows of
the shrubbery they waited while
two figures strolled toward them. Two women
stopped directly in front of them. One was
speaking and they recognized the voice of the
Dean.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But don’t you see—that candy was meant for
me. If Miss Horton became ill eating it——”</p>

<p class='c008'>The doctor nodded. “You had a narrow escape.
You don’t know who sent it to you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>They continued on their way and the girls
glanced at one another. When they had safely
and secretly entered Happiness House by the rear
door which they had left unlocked when they
went out and were again in their room Phyllis
smiled:</p>

<p class='c008'>“I guess your hunch was correct.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mmm,” Gale murmured, staring into the
darkness as she lay in bed. “Do you suppose they
were talking about her secretary? If so, she became
ill eating candy that was originally sent to
the Dean.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Poisoned?” Phyllis hazarded.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t know.” Gale raised herself on one elbow
and looked across at Phyllis. “Do you remember
Janet saying one of the Chemistry
teachers was sending her candy?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Say——” Phyllis sat up suddenly. “Chemistry
Professor, acid, poisoned candy—they all fit
together.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We aren’t sure the candy was poisoned, but
that is what I was thinking,” Gale murmured.
“However, there are four Chemistry professors.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The question is which one of them threw the
acid and poisoned the candy,” Phyllis agreed.
She yawned. “I am afraid the puzzle will have to
wait until morning. This detective is getting
sleepy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale wanted to lie awake and think over the
puzzling circumstances surrounding the Dean
and her reign at Briarhurst, but she didn’t, and
it was to be many weeks before the mysterious
occurrences were solved.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch05' class='c009'><i>Chapter V</i><br /> <br />THE HOCKEY GAME</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The Freshman class proved to have a very
fine hockey team. The girls, including Phyllis,
Gale, Ricky and Gloria, were all very agile,
swift and determined. The spirit of coöperation
which existed between the members of the team
was largely responsible for their victories. They
made goal after goal in perfectly timed coöperation.
They triumphed over the Sophomore team
with such a crushing score that the whole Freshman
class was delighted and held a party in their
honor.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then came the election of class president.
Phyllis, to her astonishment and delight, was
elected the Freshman president. Valerie was
elected secretary. Altogether, the Adventure
Girls were delighted to think two of their number
held offices in the class.</p>

<p class='c008'>The room in Sunshine Alley became the headquarters
for all sorts of meetings to discuss class
activities. There was scarcely any time at all
when someone wasn’t there.</p>

<p class='c008'>Still, with the activities of her office, Phyllis
found time to practice with the Freshman hockey
team. They practiced often and diligently. The
team was next scheduled to play the Junior class
and that, they were sure, would be more difficult
than the Sophomores. For one thing, Marcia
Marlette was on the Junior team. That fact made
Gale sure of a difficult encounter.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the days went by the Adventure Girls could
discover nothing new about the strange events
that had occurred to the Dean. Gradually their
interest began to fade. Occasionally Gale saw the
Dean and Doctor Norcot, but even she learned
nothing new.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale left the Chemistry class on this afternoon
without a moment’s wasted time and went to the
gymnasium and the lockers. There the girls were
gathering for the pending hockey game between
the two classes. Some of the girls were already
in their playing suits and Gale hastened into
hers. Phyllis helped her into the pads which, as
goalie, Gale needed. Phyllis, in her position of
forward, preferred to wear as little protection as
possible. She considered herself agile enough to
dodge the flying sticks when in a tussle for the
ball and was of the opinion that the shin-guards
only deterred her when she was in a hurry.</p>

<p class='c008'>There was a big turnout for the game. Janet
and Carol had elected to try out for the cheer
leaders’ club and they were on duty this afternoon
to see that their class should get a large
measure of support from the fans.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale and the opposing Junior took their positions
at the goals. The teams were in line and
the game began. The fans cheered lustily on the
slightest provocation but there was no goal
scored.</p>

<p class='c008'>Marcia Marlette was playing a brilliant game,
even the Freshmen had to admit that. She was
here and there and everywhere. She had the ball
headed toward the goal every chance she got.
Once Gale parried a desperate shot of Marcia’s
that would have meant the first score had it been
a little harder and a little straighter.</p>

<p class='c008'>But the Junior team did not have the same
spirit of coöperation that characterized the
younger girls. Marcia was playing for personal
glory. The girls could all see that. More than
once, if Marcia had passed the ball to a team
mate who was in the clear, a score might have
been made, but she preferred to play it herself
and each time irrevocably lost.</p>

<p class='c008'>Such was not the case with Phyllis and her
team mates, however. They did not hesitate to
pass to one another. They were not playing for
their own brilliant performances, rather for the
game. They wanted their team to win and they
did everything in their power to make it so. So
unconquerable was their enthusiasm that the
score mounted in favor of the Freshmen. Goal
after goal was made.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Lucky for us, Marcia isn’t particularly brilliant,”
Janet told Carol on the sidelines. “If she
didn’t want to be the whole show herself, the
Juniors would easily win over us.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Treason in the Freshman class!” Carol
frowned upon her. “Don’t you think we have a
good team?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course,” Janet said. “But look at Marcia.
She is casting daggers from her greenish eyes at
Phyl. One would think there was no one else on
the field but Marcia and Phyllis. They have been
watching and checkmating each other all afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“She would dearly love to wrap her stick
around Phyllis’ neck—or Gale’s,” giggled Carol.
“There they go!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Marcia and a class mate were dribbling the
ball ever closer to the Freshman goal. Gale was
on guard. Phyllis and Ricky swept in to rescue
the ball and save the game.</p>

<p class='c008'>There was a sudden mix-up of flying sticks,
arms and legs. Two of the players sprawled into
the goalie. Gale had a fleeting vision of Marcia
Marlette striking out viciously with her stick
before she went down under the impact of another
Junior.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale scrambled to her feet. The others did likewise—that
is all but Phyllis. She lay perfectly
still, her one leg twisted under her. Janet and
Carol dashed out from the sidelines. A sudden
hush had fallen over the spectators.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Phyl!” Gale cried and dropped beside her
friend.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s the matter?” Doctor Norcot and Professor
Lukens had appeared from among the
spectators.</p>

<p class='c008'>After a brief examination by the doctor, Professor Lukens
picked Phyllis up in his arms and
started toward the infirmary with her.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale tore off the padding of her position and
ran after them.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But the game——” mildly protested a Junior.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Get another goalie,” directed Gale and was
gone.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale was forced to wait in the doctor’s office.
She wriggled impatiently in the uncomfortable
leather chair. Getting to her feet she walked restlessly
to the window and around the room. There
were a lot of medical books here which at another
time would have interested her immensely. However,
now she could think of nothing but Phyllis,
of the whiteness of her friend’s face and the
stillness with which she had lain on the field.</p>

<p class='c008'>The door knob turned and the doctor came
into the room. She was in the white clothes of her
profession and wore the professional smile.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Phyl——” Gale said.</p>

<p class='c008'>“She’ll be all right,” the doctor assured her,
“but her leg is fractured.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“B-Broken?” Gale managed to whisper.</p>

<p class='c008'>Doctor Norcot nodded. “She must have been
hit with a hockey stick—a vicious hit.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But she will be all right?” Gale insisted.</p>

<p class='c008'>“After a few weeks she will be as good as new,”
the doctor promised. “Would you like to see
her?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, yes!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale found Phyllis awake and grumbling. The
sight of her friend made Gale’s heart twinge with
pity. Phyllis was trying so hard to be brave.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ve climbed ivy trellises, even jumped out of
an airplane with a parachute—and I break my
leg playing in a hockey game,” Phyllis said disgustedly.
“A fine class president you picked!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We picked a good one!” Gale said quickly.
“We——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“In here?” a voice said and the door was
opened.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hi,” Janet said.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We came as quickly as we could when we
thought we could see you,” added Carol.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who won the game?” Phyllis demanded.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We did,” Ricky said, “because you played so
well before——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Before Marcia Marlette cracked you with her
hockey stick,” Janet added savagely.</p>

<p class='c008'>“She didn’t do it,” Phyllis said wearily. “No
one can say who did it. Sticks were flying in all
directions.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Janet said nothing more but she and Gale exchanged
significant glances. The girls did not
stay long after that. It was evident that Phyllis
was tired and they thoughtfully took their leave
early, but Phyllis detained Gale long after the
others. Gale held her friend’s hand until Phyllis
was asleep then she softly left the room.</p>

<p class='c008'>Slowly, deep in thought, Gale stepped from the
infirmary building to the campus. A chill night
wind had sprung up. She turned toward the gymnasium.
She was still in her hockey suit. She
would have to go to the lockers and change before
going to the sorority house.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dinner had been an hour ago but she scarcely
missed the comfort of her meal. She had been so
worried about Phyllis she did not realize how
time had flown past. Finding the janitor was an
easy task. He unlocked the door to the gymnasium
for her and she wasted no time in going to
the lockers for her things. Stepping again onto
the campus, now warm in her woollen jacket,
Gale caught sight of the Dean crossing the
campus to her home. Dean Travis beckoned to
Gale and waited until the Freshman joined her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How is your friend?” she asked immediately.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale told her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You missed your dinner, didn’t you?” the
Dean continued. “Come home with me. We will
dine together.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, but I——” Gale began confusedly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Forget I am the Dean for this one night,”
Dean Travis invited humorously. She smiled and
Gale could not resist. “I’ve wanted to talk with
you often, Gale. You aren’t merely one of the
Freshmen to me, you know. You are a friend.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale found the living room of the Dean’s home
cozy and warm. A wood fire burned in the fireplace.
She sat on the divan before it and let the
warmth of the flames ease away some of the
nervousness she still felt from her worry over
Phyllis. The dinner was the best she had had at
Briarhurst, at least she enjoyed it the most. She
talked to the Dean as she might have to one of
the girls. There was no stiffness or formality between
them. She found herself telling the Dean
about Phyllis and about the letter she, Gale, must
write when she returned to the sorority house. It
was a letter to Phyllis’ aunt, the cold, austere
woman who was paying Phyllis’ tuition at Briarhurst.
Gale did not like Miss Fields. She resented
the way the woman so completely dominated
Phyllis’ life and the blind obedience she exacted
from the girl.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was late when Gale got back to the sorority
house. Adele Stevens met her at the door.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How is Phyllis?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale told her all the details she could and together
they walked up to Gale’s room. There the
sorority president stopped to chat a while. When
she left Gale found it lonesome. It would be hard
to get used to living alone for a few weeks. Phyllis
was always so gay, so friendly and understanding,
Gale would certainly miss her.</p>

<p class='c008'>She sat down at her desk to write to Miss
Fields. It was the most difficult task she had ever
had to do. She didn’t like Phyllis’ aunt and her
letter was not the friendly, sympathetic epistle
it might have been had she been writing to one of
the other girls’ mothers. When she finished she
read the note through. It was decidedly stiff and
unfriendly. She tore it up and began another. She
finally enclosed her fifth attempt in an envelope
and stamped it. She was sure Phyllis would receive
scant sympathy from Miss Fields. The
woman, in all the years since Phyllis was small,
had given the girl no obvious affection, no love.
Phyllis always had been afraid of her, always
had to obey her blindly and implicitly. Gale remembered
how difficult it had been for Phyllis
to come to Briarhurst with the rest of the Adventure
Girls. And now this had to happen! How
would Miss Fields accept the news? That worried
Gale quite as much as it did Phyllis.</p>

<p class='c008'>Standing at the window, watching shadows
moving slowly on the campus as clouds drifted
past the moon, Gale thought of what Janet had
said that afternoon. Had Marcia deliberately hit
Phyllis with her hockey stick? Gale’s more charitable
nature rebelled at the thought. Marcia
might be selfish, stubborn, not at all likeable, but
surely she wouldn’t do anything like that!</p>

<p class='c008'>The Freshmen had won the game but at what a
cost. Her zeal for the game would cost Phyllis
days of suffering and weeks of inactivity that
would be even harder to bear. Mentally Gale
made a promise to help Phyllis all she could.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch06' class='c009'><i>Chapter VI</i><br /> <br />A NOTE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“Surprise!” Phyllis said gaily.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale stared in amazement. Phyllis was in
her own bed in their room in Sunshine Alley yet
she hadn’t been there that morning. Doctor Norcot
stood beside the bed smiling. Adele Stevens
was on the other side.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Phyl!” Gale stuttered. “What—why—how—my
dear, I’m so glad to see you!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“She wouldn’t give me a moment’s peace until
I said she could come back here,” Doctor Norcot
explained, smiling.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll get well twice as quickly here,” Phyllis
declared. “I feel a hundred per cent better already.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sunshine Alley will cure her,” Adele Stevens
laughed.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the doctor and Adele were gone Gale sat
beside Phyllis and hugged her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Gee, I’m glad to have you back. If you hadn’t
come soon I would be talking to myself.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Tell me everything that has happened in
these weeks,” Phyllis demanded. “Who has done
what and why?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, the teacher gave us a corking examination
in Biology today but I don’t know why,”
Gale laughed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I suppose it was to see how brilliant you
were,” Phyllis smiled. “Gale! Guess what! Monday
I start classes again. I’ll have to go on
crutches for a while but at least I won’t have to
stay in one room any longer. Isn’t it marvelous?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ll have a party and celebrate,” Gale proposed.
“I’ll tell Janet and Carol to come over. Let
them climb our trellis this time. I’ll make fudge
and——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wait a minute! You take my breath away,”
Phyllis declared. “Oh, Gale, you have no idea
how lonesome it was over there in the infirmary.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know how lonesome it was here,” Gale
countered. “This was bad enough. All by myself
at night, I’d dream I saw ghosts—I almost moved
over to the infirmary to be with you,” she
laughed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I hear that the Dean has started the work
on the stables for the horses we are to have
in the spring,” Phyllis said. “We will have a
lot of fun riding. Remember that summer in
Arizona?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ll have fun if we can stay on the horses,”
Gale giggled. “Ricky is an authority on the subject
and she doesn’t know we can ride so she has
been giving us some lessons.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Without horses?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We use chairs and things,” Gale explained,
“but a real live horse will be more difficult to
handle than a chair with a pillow on it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Rightly spoken, my friend,” Ricky herself declared,
entering unannounced at that moment.
“Phyllis! You’re back! Gee! Hi, Glory,” she
shouted across the hall to her roommate, “look
who is here! Our star hockey player is back!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Sunshine Alley became alive with figures eager
to welcome Phyllis back. The Freshman president
had been sadly missed.</p>

<p class='c008'>That night the room was the scene of a secret
rendezvous of the Adventure Girls. Valerie and
Madge had managed to unobtrusively sneak out
of their dormitory house with Janet and Carol.
A light hidden under a tilted wastepaper basket
enabled just enough light to escape to dispel the
darkness while the girls sat around and talked
in whispers and ate Gale’s fudge.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Has anybody heard anything more about
strange things happening to the Dean?” Phyllis
asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>The others shook silent heads. However, Janet
spoke up.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I was in French class late the other day and
when I came out two teachers were talking in the
hall. I dropped my book accidentally and while
I was picking it up I couldn’t help but hear what
they said. It was strange.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well? What did they say?” Carol inquired
lazily.</p>

<p class='c008'>“One said ‘Then the President hasn’t yet discovered
who took the money from the fund?’”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes?” Gale and Phyllis leaned forward.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The other one said ‘No.’ Then they saw me
and walked away.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You scared them,” Carol accused.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What do you suppose they meant?” Madge
murmured.</p>

<p class='c008'>“By a simple act of deductive reasoning I have
come to the conclusion that there is a crook loose
on the campus,” Janet announced.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Did you think of that all by yourself?” Carol
chided.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Someone took money from the school funds?”
Gale murmured. “Things are getting worse.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why don’t they call a policeman?” Carol
asked, juggling a book on her head.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And get the college name spread over every
newspaper in the country? That would be a nice
scandal for the school!” Janet scoffed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s better than having our things disappear
from under our very noses,” Carol retorted.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No one has touched any of the students’
things,” Valerie reminded them. “It seems to
be the college and the Dean who are in difficulty.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wonder who is doing it?” Phyllis murmured.
“It must be someone in the college.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Did you see Marcia Marlette this afternoon?”
Carol started to giggle. “Where was she
going? She was dressed in all her finery.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“She had everything on but the kitchen sink,”
added Janet with a laugh.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I hear that Professor Lukens, the Chemistry
teacher, has conferences with her after classes
sometimes,” Madge murmured.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He has with Gale, too,” Valerie smiled.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Aha! Rivals!” Carol jeered and dodged a
magazine thrown by Gale.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How about the stables going up over behind
the Chemistry Hall? Wait until I dash down College
Avenue on a pure white steed——” Carol
began theatrically.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You will fall off,” Janet said dryly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Carol made a face at her. “How do you get
down from a horse?” she inquired sagely.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Jump,” offered Janet.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Step down,” Madge said.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You don’t, you get it from a duck,” Carol said
sweetly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Janet choked on her fudge. Madge threw a
handy pillow while Carol took refuge behind
Phyllis.</p>

<p class='c008'>“In case you don’t know,” she continued,
“down is what you stuff pillows with.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You don’t have to explain,” Janet said distastefully.
“After that terrible pun I think I had
better take you back to the dormitory. Come
along, infant.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“See you tomorrow, Phyl,” Valerie said in
parting.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But I don’t want to go to bed yet,” protested
Carol.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Shshsh,” Gale warned. She listened at the
door. “Someone is coming.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where’ll we hide?” whispered Janet frantically.</p>

<p class='c008'>Carol dived under the bed. Janet did likewise
while Valerie and Madge ran to the closet. Gale
put the light out and hopped into her bed. Innocent
silence settled down over the room. Footsteps
halted at the door. Cautiously the doorknob
turned, but the door did not open. Instead,
something white was shoved under the door.
When the footsteps had retreated along the corridor
again the girls cautiously came out of hiding.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now go ahead and sneeze!” Janet stormed at
Carol. “If we had been discovered it would have
been your fault. You always have to sneeze at
the strangest times!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I can’t help it,” Carol giggled. “You tickled
me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We had better get out before we are discovered,”
Madge whispered fearfully.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wait until we see what is in the note,” Janet
proposed. “Open it, Gale.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale lit the light again, under its protective
shield, and picked up the square white envelope
lying on the floor. She turned it over in her hand.
There was no address upon it. She tore it open
and while the other girls waited read the few
words. She stared retrospectively at the floor.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well?” Carol hissed. “Is it a secret?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What? Oh——” Gale turned to the note
again. “It says ‘Do not interfere in affairs that
are none of your concern.’”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is that all?” Carol said in disappointment.
“No—no threats?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What can it mean?” Phyllis whispered to
Gale.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Just what it says,” Janet declared bluntly.
“We are to mind our own business—or else.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Or else what?” Carol demanded.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mind our own business,” Madge repeated.
“But what have we interfered in?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“True,” Valerie admitted. “We haven’t done
anything.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale sat on the bed beside Phyllis. “I wonder
if this was meant only for you and me—or for
all of us,” she murmured.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No one knows we are here tonight—at least
I hope no one knows,” Janet said.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is obvious someone doesn’t want us to discover
something,” Phyllis murmured.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But what?” Carol insisted. “Mixed up, I call
it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re always mixed up,” Janet said loftily.
“Can’t you understand, darling, that whoever
wrote this note is afraid of us?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We aren’t that bad looking,” Carol protested
humorously. “What are they afraid of?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wish we knew,” Gale said. “However, now
that we are accused of prying into whatever it is,
we will really do some prying.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll sleep with my eyes and ears wide open,”
Carol promised.</p>

<p class='c008'>The girls took their leave then, sneaking as
noiselessly as possible down the corridor and out
the back door of the building. Gale went downstairs
with them, locked the door and returned
to her room. She found Phyllis still awake and
pondering the strange note.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who left it, Gale?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale shook her head. “I wish I knew. It might
make things clearer.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“At any rate, we must know something that
we shouldn’t,” Phyllis said wisely. “What will
we do about it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale ran restless fingers through her curls. “I
don’t know, Phyl. I was beginning to think things
were calming down. Now this——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Stirs them up again,” Phyllis said. “You had
better go to bed, Gale, you are tired.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And you, Phyl,” Gale said contritely. “This
has been a day for you, hasn’t it? The Doctor
would scold if she knew you have had scarcely
any rest since this morning.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Bother the Doctor,” Phyllis said fretfully.
“Gale, promise me you won’t do anything about
that note until I can go with you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale nodded slowly. “When I do something
I’ll tell you—but I don’t know what we could
do,” she added helplessly.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch07' class='c009'><i>Chapter VII</i><br /> <br />NO CLUES</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Gale hastily deposited her own and Phyllis’
books in their room and went flying downstairs
again. Phyllis, out on her new crutches, was
waiting for her on the campus. Together the two
slowly made their way to the home of the Dean.
They had seen her leave the office only a few
minutes earlier and hoped she would interview
them. Or rather, Gale corrected her thoughts, let
them interview her.</p>

<p class='c008'>The girls had talked things over long and earnestly.
They had let several days elapse, but now
they had decided the best thing to do was to go
to the Dean with the note that had mysteriously
appeared in their room.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale proposed to tell the Dean everything that
the girls knew or suspected—things which the
Dean, herself, already knew. The attempts on the
Dean had been interpreted by the girls to mean
direct attempts to seriously injure her. Now they
wanted to know why. Since someone had chosen
to link them to the mysterious events, by means
of that note, they felt they had a right to share
the mystery whatever it was.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale was trying to fit the pieces of the puzzle
together as they walked along. First there had
been the canoe, then the acid hurled from the
Chemistry room window, the candy eaten by
Dean Travis’ secretary—and other things that
had come to her ears such as the fire in the Dean’s
home and the stolen funds from the college treasury.
But what was it the girls knew that someone
feared? Try as she would, Gale could not think
of a thing that pointed directly to any one person.
There was no reason anyone should suspect
the Adventure Girls of being interested in the
Dean’s difficulties.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is glorious being able to be about again,”
Phyllis sighed as she rested a moment. “I can
hardly wait for the time I’ll be able to play
hockey again.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I shouldn’t think you would want to play,”
Gale said laughingly. “You’ve been so brave,
Phyl,” she added more seriously.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Tush!” Phyllis smiled.</p>

<p class='c008'>But Gale was not deceived. She knew Phyllis
well, she knew her friend’s moods and lately she
had recognized the strain Phyllis was under. The
confinement Phyllis had undergone was desperately
trying. Phyllis was active, she was full of
life. She had to be doing things, accomplishing
things to be content. If anything should happen
to take away Phyllis’ activities and zest for enjoyment,
life would not mean much to the girl.
The courage she had displayed these past weeks
had been strongly aided by the knowledge that
with patience she would be able to go back to her
old activities again. It was only because she knew
her indisposition was but temporary that Phyllis
had been able to bear it so cheerfully.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale ran lightly up the steps of the Dean’s
home while Phyllis waited. Steps were difficult
for her to negotiate and she would not do
it unless she were certain the Dean would see
them.</p>

<p class='c008'>The maid answered Gale’s ring. She said the
Dean was home and would see them. When the
girls were in the living room the Dean entered.
She smiled naturally upon Gale and shook hands
with Phyllis.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m delighted to see you about again, Miss
Elton.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m delighted to be about again,” Phyllis said
happily.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dean Travis, we came to see you because—that
is we think——” Gale paused for breath
then continued more resolutely, “The day I
towed your canoe to shore you made me promise
not to mention the subject. I haven’t—generally.
Since then I’ve heard of things that have happened
to you. What you said made me think the
acid was thrown out the window that day
and——”</p>

<p class='c008'>The Dean held up her hand for silence. She
was staring past Gale. The Freshman turned.
The door behind her was slowly closing.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Suppose we walk on the campus,” the Dean
proposed in a low voice. “We can be sure there
will be no prying ears there.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you want to wait for us, Phyl?” Gale
asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, indeed!” Phyllis said vigorously. “It may
be hard for me to get around but I won’t remain
behind. I’m not going to miss anything.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The three walked slowly in the direction of the
Chemistry Hall in back of which work was being
carried on building the new stables. The workmen
were finished for the day so the girls and the
Dean could inspect the scene while they talked.
Lumber was piled high in readiness for the building,
the foundation was already dug and the
ground was littered with implements and discarded
stones and bricks.</p>

<p class='c008'>The three halted near a pile of lumber. No one
was in sight, so Gale continued with the tale she
had. When she had finished the Dean looked at
both Gale and Phyllis thoughtfully for a moment
before she spoke.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What you say is true,” she agreed. “Strange
things have been happening, but I see no reason
why you should be connected with me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You see,” Phyllis put in, “we have always
been mystery fans and we have been keeping our
eyes and ears open. Perhaps someone found out
we were snooping——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But we haven’t discovered anything,” Gale
said. “Dean Travis, what about the money that
was stolen? Did someone take money from the
college funds?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The Dean nodded slowly. “Since you know so
much I will tell you what little more there is to
be told. Someone, we don’t know who, took
money—cash—from the safe in my office. The
balance of the money, however, is in the bank and
quite safe.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Haven’t you any idea who might have taken
it?” Phyllis pursued.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Four people have the combination, and I am
convinced that each one is trustworthy. About
the other occurrences—you already know as
much as I.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why did Professor Harris give up her position
as Dean?” Gale asked suddenly. She had for
a long time been thinking that the former Dean
might be trying to revenge herself upon the new
head for taking her position.</p>

<p class='c008'>“She went abroad to live in England, I believe,”
Dean Travis said. “She had been planning
it for quite a while.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And then you were appointed,” Gale murmured.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wasn’t there an election or something?”
Phyllis asked. “Wasn’t there anyone else trying
for the position the same time as you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I believe there was,” the Dean smiled. “Are
you trying to make me believe that my rival for
the position has sworn revenge? No, girls, I don’t
think that is possible.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What does Doctor Norcot think about these
things?” Gale asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“She is at quite a loss to explain them,” the
Dean murmured.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The day she ran back to the Chemistry room—she
saw no one?” Gale continued hopefully.
“I’m sorry, Dean, this sounds like a cross examination,
doesn’t it? We are being terribly nosey,
but it is only because we are so interested.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Since someone is sending us notes it makes us
all the more curious,” added Phyllis. “I would
like to know who sent us that note.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you have it with you?” the Dean asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale pulled it from her coat pocket and unfolded
it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You see,” she said, “it is typewritten so there
is no danger of recognizing the handwriting.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“About every other person at Briarhurst has a
portable typewriter,” Phyllis frowned. “We are
absolutely stumped for clues.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Aren’t you afraid to stay here with so many
things happening?” Gale asked the Dean.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Dean shook her head smilingly. “I’ve been
entrusted with this position and I am going to
see it through to the best of my ability. I am going
to make Briarhurst an even finer and larger
college than it already is. That is, of course, with
the coöperation of the girls.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You have our coöperation,” Phyllis said
promptly. “All the Adventure Girls and some
others are keenly interested in everything you
propose—the new organ for the chapel, the new
and different classes, the horses for spring riding,
all of them. It will be really wonderful. I’ve always
wanted to ride well,” she continued softly.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Dean tapped Phyllis’ crutch. “Doctor
Norcot tells me it will be only a week or so and
you won’t have to use these any more. I’m glad.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“So am I,” Phyllis said vigorously. “I——”</p>

<p class='c008'>Her words froze in a cry of horror on her lips.
The pile of lumber against which Gale and the
Dean were leaning was tottering. Phyllis threw
herself forward, shoving and dragging Gale and
the Dean clear, but in so doing was herself
caught in the avalanche of lumber as it toppled
down upon them.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch08' class='c009'><i>Chapter VIII</i><br /> <br />MYSTERIOUS STRANGER</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Gale could never quite clearly remember
her dash to the infirmary after Doctor
Norcot, but finally Phyllis was there, shut into a
room with the doctor and nurse and Gale and
the Dean were in the corridor. Gale was pacing
up and down, the Dean watching her. It was dark
outside and a single light made a white circle on
the tile floor and walls.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale stopped her pacing long enough to glare
at the door to Phyllis’ room. She had a wild desire
to throw it open and burst in.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Be patient a little longer, Gale,” the Dean
said compassionately. “You can see her in a few
minutes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why did it have to be her?” Gale asked in an
agonized whisper. “She suffered so much these
past weeks after the hockey accident and
now—— She did it saving us! We might have
been crushed under that lumber.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The door opened and the Doctor came out followed
by a nurse.</p>

<p class='c008'>“May I go in?” Gale asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Doctor nodded wearily. “Be cheerful,
make her smile but don’t let her get excited or
talk too much.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m so full of splinters I can’t even smile,”
Phyllis said gloomily when Gale was beside her.
“You had better go get your dinner.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You aren’t going to get rid of me so easily,”
Gale laughed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phyllis’ face was all scratched and she looked
white and tired.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Honestly, Phyl——” she began when she remembered
the Doctor’s warning. “This was a fine
thing for you to do. Now I’ll be by myself in our
room tonight again. See that you are back tomorrow,
young lady, or I shall move in here with
you. After all, I believe you did it so you
wouldn’t have to go to Biology class tomorrow.
There is more than one way of escaping
an exam. Though I can’t say I would choose this
way.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t talk so much,” Phyllis said bluntly.
“You don’t know a word you are saying.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale nodded soberly. “Right you are. I can’t
think of a thing but the way you pulled us out
of danger this afternoon and now you——” She
took her friend’s hand. “I’ll make it up to you
sometime, Phyl.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Go way,” Phyllis said tenderly. “Go get your
dinner and study your old Biology and come and
see me tomorrow.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale went out and found the Doctor and the
Dean in conference in the corridor.</p>

<p class='c008'>“She seems to be all right,” Gale said.</p>

<p class='c008'>“She has the courage of six girls,” the Doctor
said firmly. “But, Miss Howard, I am afraid your
friend is right where she was five weeks ago.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You mean her leg——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Crushed under the lumber this afternoon,”
the Doctor said. “Not too badly crushed but
enough to undo the healing of these past weeks.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Poor Phyllis!” Gale whispered.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you think she would want to go home
until she is well again?” the Dean asked as she
walked to the door with Gale.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale shook her head. “No,” she said decidedly.
“Phyllis wouldn’t want to go home.” Strange,
perhaps, that she should choose to stay here, but
even the college infirmary was brighter, more
cheerful than the house on the hill to which Phyllis
would have to go.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come and have your dinner with me,” the
Dean invited.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thanks, no,” Gale said when they were on the
campus. “I—I’d rather be alone, thank you. I
have to write Phyllis’ aunt again,” she sighed.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Dean turned toward her office and Gale
toward Happiness House. She walked along,
hands in her pockets, deep in thought until at
last she reached the sorority house. She met
Adele Stevens and Ricky and conveyed to them
the news of Phyllis. After her dinner she went
upstairs to study but she found she could not
concentrate.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phyllis was on her mind. Alternated with
thoughts of her friend were remembrances of the
conversation they had had with the Dean that
afternoon. She was completely at sea as to who
could be doing the mysterious things. Quite suddenly
she sat erect before her desk and stared
with narrowed eyes at the wall opposite. That
had been a goodly pile of lumber this afternoon.
It had been piled, perhaps a bit precariously,
but nevertheless it had not wavered until that
moment before it fell. Could it be—was it possible—that
someone had pushed it? The pile really
had needed but a bit of pressure to send it over.
Who had exerted that bit of pressure?</p>

<p class='c008'>At first Gale laughed at herself. It was a wild
idea! No one would do that! But the more she
thought about it the more plausible it became.
She had thought no one would throw acid out the
Chemistry Hall window—but evidently someone
had!</p>

<p class='c008'>Then she remembered the note the Dean had
had in her hand when the lumber fell upon Phyllis.
She had a fleeting vision of the same note lying
in the mud unheeded. Their one valuable clue
gone!</p>

<p class='c008'>Catching up her coat Gale switched out the
light and stepped into the hall. No one was in
sight. She sped down the stairs and at the bottom
bumped into Adele Stevens.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where are you going, Gale?” the Senior
asked. “It is study hour.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know,” Gale said breathlessly. “I—I can’t
study. I thought I’d go for a short walk.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thinking about Phyllis?” Adele said kindly.
“All right, Gale. I suppose you can tonight. Be
back before lights-out bell.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I will,” Gale breathed and was gone before
the sorority president could change her mind.</p>

<p class='c008'>The late autumn evening was clear and cold.
The leafless branches of the trees rubbed together
making queer eerie noises. Windows of the dormitory
and sorority houses shone yellow with
light. Gale stepped along briskly. She passed the
dormitory houses and halted before the Chemistry
Hall. There was a light burning in the third
floor laboratory. Was one of the Professors
working late? Probably. She turned away into
the shadows behind the building.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was terribly dark in here. She took the small
flashlight from her coat pocket and switched it
on. She had been just about to stumble into a
mud puddle. Now she jumped across it and proceeded
with caution. She came to the scene of
the afternoon. The lumber lay as it had fallen.
In her mind’s eye Gale could still see Phyllis lying
there. She shivered and turned away. Carefully
she went over the ground. Caught under a
board, torn almost in half, Gale found the note.
It was dirty and wrinkled and torn but she carefully
folded it in the original creases and stored
it in her coat pocket. She switched off her flashlight
and stood listening. Had she heard a sound?</p>

<p class='c008'>The moon was completely hidden behind a
cloud. The wind whistled in her ears. She shivered
in her warm coat. It wasn’t the cold, it was
the darkness, the shadowy world about her, and
the knowledge of another’s presence. She strained
her ears to catch the faintest sound. There was a
sudden creak and a smothered exclamation as
someone stumbled over a bit of lumber. Gale
crouched against half-piled boards and waited.</p>

<p class='c008'>A man’s figure was outlined against the light
from the moving clouds. A hat pulled low on his
forehead and a long overcoat with collar turned
up completely hid his identity. Gale considered
jumping in front of him and flashing her light in
his face. She would know who he was then! But
she reconsidered the next moment, and waited to
see what he was after. It was obvious that he was
searching for something. He crouched low to the
ground, examining every foot of space thoroughly
with a small pocket lamp. What could he be
searching for? Could it be the note in her pocket?
Convulsively her hand closed about the muddy
piece of paper. It must be this! There was nothing
else here. Gale took a step backward as the
figure moved closer. That was the fatal moment.
She stumbled wildly over something and fell.
The clatter was distinct and as loud as a cannon
shot in the stillness. The man whirled. He flashed
his light full into Gale’s face. She blinked in the
sudden glare and did not move. In another second
the light was gone and the figure had fled
toward the campus.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale scrambled to her feet but it was hopeless
to think of pursuit. If only she hadn’t fallen! Her
clumsiness had spoiled everything! The man was
gone now and so was her chance of solving the
mystery. She shook the mud from her coat and
picked her way back to the campus.</p>

<p class='c008'>The light was gone from the Chemistry laboratory.
A lot of windows in the other dormitories
were dark, too. It was growing late. Gale hastened
her steps. She had to be in before lights-out
bell rang. She had promised Adele, and not only
that, she didn’t fancy being out late on the
campus with that mysterious stranger—the mystery
man who knew her identity but whom she
did not know. He had her at a decided disadvantage.
He knew, now, who was spying on him and
noting his movements. She knew she must guard
against someone, but whom? If only she had discovered
his identity! She rebuked herself again.
She would have given nearly all she possessed to
know who else wanted the note.</p>

<p class='c008'>When she returned to her room she examined
the bit of paper more closely. Through the dirt,
after she had carefully pasted the torn parts together,
the brief typewritten message was still
clearly legible. There was nothing to distinguish
this typewriting from any other except—the letter
R was slightly raised above the level of the
other letters. That might help a little in identifying
the typewriter. If she found a machine
which had that little peculiarity it might lead to
the mysterious stranger.</p>

<p class='c008'>She smiled to herself as she switched off her
light and got into bed. She would turn all the
girls into Sherlock Holmeses seeking and trying
all the typewriters they could find.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch09' class='c009'><i>Chapter IX</i><br /> <br />BAD NEWS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Noiselessly Gale closed the door behind
her. Swiftly her glance traveled over the
room. Girls’ things were strewn about in disorder.
Gale smiled to herself with mingled pride
and humor. At least her own room and Phyllis’
didn’t look like this and this room belonged to
Juniors! Cautiously she bent down and looked
under the bed. Yes, it was here. She pulled out
the black case and snapped back the lid.
With nervous fingers she inserted a sheet of
paper in the portable typewriter. She typed a
few words and tore the sheet out again. She
had just snapped the lid and shoved the case
beneath the bed once more when she heard
voices.</p>

<p class='c008'>Marcia was returning! Gale ran for the closet.
There was no time to slip out of the room without
being seen. She hid in the depths behind the
dresses. The door was open a crack. She could
hear but she could not see what went on in the
room.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now where did I leave them?” Marcia’s voice
demanded fretfully.</p>

<p class='c008'>Another lazy voice belonging to Marcia’s roommate
inquired:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Delivering more notes for Professor Lukens?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No. It’s my Latin notes—here they are! Let’s
go, we’ll be late.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The two girls were gone as quickly and as suddenly
as they had come. Gale lost no time in
making her way out of their room. She went
downstairs to her room where Valerie was waiting
for her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Did you get it?” Valerie asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale sank onto the bed and heaved a sigh of
relief. “I did, and I nearly got caught. Marcia
and her roommate came back while I was there.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Did they see you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale shook her head and unfolded the sheet of
paper. “I hid in the closet. Now, where is that
note?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Here.” Valerie produced the note which the
girls had received under the door.</p>

<p class='c008'>Carefully the two checked the letters. The letters
produced by Marcia’s typewriter were even
and clear cut. It was evident that the notes had
not been produced by the same machine.</p>

<p class='c008'>Valerie sat back and looked at Gale. “Well?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale shrugged and folded the papers together.
“Exhibit A is a failure. We’ll try some more.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We got it!” Carol burst in followed by Janet.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is it catching?” Valerie asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Whose is it?” Gale wanted to know.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The Chemistry Professor’s,” Carol said
proudly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And the assistant’s,” added Janet. “We covered
them both. Are we good detectives or are
we?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The check-up of the typing on the last two
notes was the same as it had been with Marcia’s.
None of them were alike and none of them resembled
the typing in the mysterious note. The
type of the Chemistry Professor’s machine was
much larger while that of his assistant was
smaller.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Shucks,” Carol said disgustedly. “We had all
that work for nothing.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Perhaps it wasn’t written by any machine
here at the college,” Valerie said.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale nodded. “True, it might not have been.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think it was,” Carol said. “There are no visitors
on whom we could blame all these mysterious
happenings, and certainly the same person
is responsible for the notes!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We will have to find some more typewriters.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Tell you what,” Janet said, “I’ve a bright
idea. Let’s give a party and hold a scavenger
hunt. We will make the items for the girls to
bring in mostly typewriters. In that way we will
have all the typewriters brought to us and we
can try them.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It would immediately make the one person
we want suspicious. He could smash his machine
then,” Carol said. “You will have to have a
brighter idea than that.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“My next bright idea is to go and visit Phyllis,”
Janet said. “All in favor——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Aye!” The vote was unanimous.</p>

<p class='c008'>The girls descended to the campus. It was
while they were passing the East Campus Dormitory
where Janet and Carol abided that another
Freshman hailed them.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hi, Carol, the house mistress wants to see you—and
she is angry,” the girl added confidentially.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If it is that little matter of a broken window——” Carol
began calmly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Broken window?” Gale asked. “In your
room?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Janet giggled. “I threw a book at Carol. She
dodged and it went through the window.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Valerie shook her head sadly. “A Freshman
trick! I am ashamed of you. To think——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“She wants to see you too,” the Freshman said
smiling, “about the broken vase in the hall.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“A Freshman trick!” Janet mimicked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It was an accident,” Valerie said firmly. “I
slipped and fell against it. I couldn’t help it if the
table wiggled and the vase fell off.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Did it fall or was it pushed?” Carol winked
at Janet.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I suppose I’ll have to go in,” Valerie sighed.</p>

<p class='c008'>That left Gale to go on alone to the infirmary
to see Phyllis. That young lady was chafing at
the delay in her recovery. It was a week now
since the second accident and she wanted to get
back to Happiness House and on her feet. She
did not like the restrictions placed on her by the
Doctor and frankly told her so. Doctor Norcot
merely smiled and told her to be good.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale told Phyllis all the news of the campus
and only when it was nearing dinner time did she
leave. When she closed the door to Phyllis’ room
behind her she noticed the Doctor standing in
the hall. She beckoned to Gale and the Freshman
followed the physician to her office. There
Gale sat in the chair facing the Doctor across her
desk.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is anything the matter?” Gale asked when
she noted the tenseness of the Doctor’s expression
and the frown on the usually smiling features.</p>

<p class='c008'>The latter nodded gloomily. “There is—a
great deal.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Has anything happened to the Dean?” Gale
asked, the mystery still uppermost in her mind.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No,” the Doctor said getting up and pacing
to the window. “No, she is quite safe.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then it is Phyllis,” Gale said with quiet conviction.
“What is it? Tell me!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Doctor Norcot came across and leaned against
the corner of the desk at Gale’s side.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What sort of a woman is Miss Elton’s aunt?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale was taken somewhat by surprise. Why
should she ask about Phyllis’ aunt?</p>

<p class='c008'>“She——” Gale fumbled for words. “She isn’t
exactly pleasant,” she said at last quite frankly.
“Cold—aloof—stern. Why?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Has she money?” Doctor Norcot asked next.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale was more astounded than ever.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I—I don’t know,” she said finally. “She keeps
a big house—but not lavishly. She is sending
Phyllis to college. I suppose she must have.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Does she love her niece? I mean, would she do
anything for Phyllis?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale sat back in her chair and looked squarely
at the Doctor.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t understand, Doctor. Why don’t you
ask Phyllis these things? Why do you want to
know?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Because——” Doctor Norcot laid her hand
gently on Gale’s shoulder. “Because unless your
friend has an operation she will never walk again—not
as other girls.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh!” Gale shrank at the picture presented to
her. Phyllis helpless! Phyllis never to run or
dance or play with the girls again.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But isn’t there something we can do? I’ll do
anything!” she told the Doctor passionately.
“Anything!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“An operation will cost money. Unless she has
it——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Unless she has it,” Gale echoed faintly. “How
much would you charge for the operation, Doctor?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I wouldn’t perform it,” the Doctor said.
“I’m not a surgeon. But we would have to get
a good one—the best in the East. Otherwise she
hasn’t a chance.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Have—have you told her?” Gale asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No—quite frankly, I haven’t the heart.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“She is so brave,” Gale agreed simply. “It is
horrible to think——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I had to tell you,” the Doctor said. “Between
us perhaps we can think of something to do.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale passed a dazed hand across her eyes. “I
can’t think of anything right now.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It has been a shock. We will talk about it
again tomorrow.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale rose and went to the door. “Do you think
we should tell Phyllis yet?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Doctor Norcot smiled slowly. “Suppose we
wait a little while. There is no use to frighten her.
When we tell her we might be able to promise her
recovery later.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale was in a daze as she walked across the
campus. Phyllis, the girl who had always been
so active, so gay in the face of tremendous odds,
was faced now with a sterner bit of life than had
yet confronted her. It would take every bit of
courage Phyllis possessed to face the news when
the Doctor told her.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale had no rosy hopes that Miss Fields would
help. Phyllis’ aunt was not the sort to be generous
and kind especially when it hurt herself. If
she did not consent to put up the money for the
operation Phyllis would suffer. The injustice of
it hurt Gale. She was Phyllis’ friend, Phyllis had
saved her and the Dean at this expense! She
must do something! But what? She didn’t have
the money—none of the girls had. They were
helpless, as helpless as Phyllis herself, to do anything.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale, instead of going immediately to the
sorority house, went down to the village. The long
walk was what she needed. The bracing air invested
her with a little optimism. After all, Miss
Fields couldn’t be as harsh as all that! She
wouldn’t want Phyllis to suffer if she could help.
At the railway station Gale sent a telegram to
Marchton asking Miss Fields to come to Briarhurst
as soon as possible and signed her own
name.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then she walked slowly back up the hill,
scorning the ride offered her by the old bus
driver. She wanted to be alone and think and not
have to listen to his garrulous chatter.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dinner was in progress when she arrived at
Happiness House. Instead of going into the dining
room she went upstairs. Once there she flung
herself upon the bed and smothered her sobs in
the pillow. Her tears were all for Phyllis; for her
own helpless position, helpless to aid the friend
who had tried to aid her, Gale, in like circumstances;
for the friend who had saved Gale
serious injury that day from the falling lumber.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Aren’t you hungry?” Ricky demanded bursting
in. “My eagle eyes caught sight of you sneaking
in just now and I—say, what’s the matter?
Gale! You aren’t sick!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale sat up, wiping away her tears. “Nope.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then why the anguish? Bucking Bronchos!
Don’t tell me you flunked your Biology!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nothing so simple,” Gale said.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Simple? Biology is anything but simple! I
never heard of so many bugs back on the ranch,”
Ricky mourned. “I sometimes wish I had stayed
there.” She put her arm about Gale. “Tell Auntie
what the trouble is.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Haltingly Gale told Ricky everything the
Doctor had said.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We gotta do something,” Ricky said. She
sniffed. “You’ll have me crying too in a minute.
Does Phyllis know?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale shook her head. “We don’t want her to—yet.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then you had better not tell the other girls,”
Ricky advised wisely. “One of them is sure to let
it slip.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale nodded. “It will be between you and me.
I’ve telegraphed her Aunt to come. The Doctor
can talk to her before we tell Phyllis.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come downstairs and have your dinner,”
Ricky coaxed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m not hungry.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Neither am I—now,” Ricky sighed. “But we
have to eat something. Remember, we have hard
classes tomorrow.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch10' class='c009'><i>Chapter X</i><br /> <br />MISS FIELDS’ VISIT</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“I am going with you!” Ricky said firmly.
Gale looked at Doctor Norcot helplessly.
When Ricky was determined upon a thing nothing
could change her mind.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why?” Gale ventured.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I want to see what this female Simon Legree
looks like,” Ricky said calmly. “You may need
my sunny presence to help persuade her.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“There won’t be much use for persuasion I’m
afraid,” Gale said drearily. “Either she has the
money or she hasn’t.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Yesterday Gale had received a telegram with
the news that Miss Fields would be in Briarhurst
this afternoon for merely an hour. As a result
Doctor Norcot and Gale were going to the railroad
station to meet her when Ricky had descended
on them with the news that she was
going along. Gale was glad of the other girl’s companionship
for the Doctor was strangely silent.</p>

<p class='c008'>The train was late and Gale found it hard to
conceal her impatience. She was impatient for
Phyllis’ Aunt to arrive and yet she dreaded meeting
her. The Adventure Girls had always feared
the silent woman in the house on the hill. Now
Gale did not fancy giving her the news about
Phyllis. She would let Doctor Norcot handle the
situation.</p>

<p class='c008'>The woman that descended from the train was
the same stern person Gale had known in Marchton.
What change she had expected Gale did not
know. She only felt now, suddenly, definitely,
that Phyllis’ case was lost before it was ever
presented. This woman would not be charitable
or generous.</p>

<p class='c008'>The three had planned to take her to the one
restaurant in the little village for luncheon.
There, seated in a booth by themselves, Gale let
Doctor Norcot tell Miss Fields all about Phyllis
while she and Ricky listened.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Doctor was eloquent in her praise of
Phyllis. In the end she stressed particularly the
need for the operation.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale forgot the dessert before her. With the
silent Ricky she watched the sharp features of
the woman opposite her. Miss Fields was regarding
the plate before her with unwavering eyes.
Not a flicker of emotion disturbed her features.
Doctor Norcot glanced at Gale and smiled, a
peculiarly baffled smile. Phyllis’ chances now lay
in Miss Fields’ hands alone. Beneath the table
Ricky’s hand caught hold of Gale’s.</p>

<p class='c008'>Miss Fields glanced at her watch and rose. “It
is almost time for my return train. Perhaps we
should go.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The girls exchanged glances with the Doctor
and followed Miss Fields from the restaurant.
Silently they walked back to the station. The
hour that Phyllis’ Aunt proposed to spend in
Briarhurst was up. Already her train was approaching.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But aren’t you going to see Phyllis?” Ricky
demanded finally. She could be quiet no longer.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What have you decided?” Gale asked breathlessly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Miss Fields looked at Gale and actually
smiled. It was a brief smile, and her eyes did not
light with friendly warmth. Then she turned to
the Doctor.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I want to thank you, Doctor Norcot, for
taking so much interest in Phyllis. I regret that
I am not able to do what you suggest.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You mean——” Gale began.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You haven’t the money?” Ricky put in
brusquely. “But you are sending Phyl to college.
You must have money!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Miss Fields’ eyes froze the garrulous Ricky
with a single glance.</p>

<p class='c008'>“My affairs are only my concern. My association
with Phyllis concerns a promise I made
many years ago. Believe me, I am truly sorry.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But you must do something!” Gale said.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phyllis’ Aunt stepped onto the train. “It is impossible
for me. Goodbye.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“A promise! Sorry!” Ricky stormed when the
train had gone and they were on their way back
to the campus. “She couldn’t keep a promise or
be sorry for anything!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wonder what she meant?” Gale murmured.
“Doctor Norcot,” she said later, “are you going
to tell Phyllis today?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The Doctor took a deep breath. “She must
know sometime. I’ll go and see her this afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll go with you,” Gale said immediately.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And I,” Ricky added.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Doctor smiled. “I would wait until tomorrow
if I were you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“She won’t want to see us,” Ricky agreed upon
second thought.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wait until tomorrow when she will feel
better. Then you must act as if nothing has happened—you
must be perfectly natural. Don’t
make it any harder for her,” the Doctor cautioned.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You can count on us,” Gale sighed. “When
can she come back to the Omega Chi house?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“In a few days,” the Doctor promised. “She
may feel better if she is with the girls.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then she won’t have to leave college?” Ricky
asked fearfully.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No,” the Doctor said, “not unless she wants
to. She will be able to attend classes and get
about but not without a cane or crutch—ever.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“There isn’t any justice!” Ricky said savagely
as she went up the Golden Stairs with Gale and
entered the latter’s room. “Why did such a thing
have to happen to Phyl? Who——” she stopped
in amazement and looked about the room.
“What’s happened?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The room was topsy turvy. Bureau drawers
were pulled out and the things tumbled about.
The desks had been thoroughly searched. Even
the closet door stood open and the girls could
see the tumult within.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale smiled. “Someone was hunting for that
note, I’ll wager.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Ricky had been taken into the girls’ confidence.
Now she stared wide-eyed at Gale. “Did
they find it do you suppose?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hardly!” Gale pulled the note from her coat
pocket. “Since I know someone else would like
to have it, I keep it with me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Have you discovered the typewriter that
wrote it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No. The girls are still hunting,” Gale laughed.
“Every time they see a typewriter they run for
it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Ricky and Gale set things to rights and then
Ricky departed to find Gloria. Gale went downstairs
and over to the dormitory house to tell
Valerie and the others about Phyllis. They might
as well all know now.</p>

<p class='c008'>She was still puzzling over Phyllis’ Aunt’s
words. A promise? To whom? No promise was
important enough to stop her aiding Phyllis
now!</p>

<p class='c008'>Miss Fields had been a mystery to the girls in
Marchton ever since they knew her. They had
always looked with awe upon the grey silent
house and the woman who lived there. Through
Phyllis they had glimpsed the life of Miss Fields—cold,
always calm. Gale reminded herself that
she had really been prepared for this. She had
not thought in the very beginning that Miss
Fields would have the money. Yet she had hoped
against hope for Phyllis’ sake. Now there was
nothing to be done.</p>

<p class='c008'>Over and over again the words recurred to
Gale. Miss Fields’ association with Phyllis concerned
a promise she had made several years ago.
But what sort of a promise? Gale, quite suddenly,
had a brilliant idea. At first she had
thought she must wait until the Christmas
vacation or at least until she went home for
Thanksgiving before she could question Miss
Fields more closely, for question her she was
going to! Certainly she was not going to consider
the matter closed now! Gale was determined
to do everything in her power to help
Phyllis. She knew she could count on the other
girls to feel the same. Gale was going to get to
the bottom of Miss Fields’ reserve! She determined
to find out just what the woman meant.
But Thanksgiving was several weeks away—Christmas
even more so. She would write to
David Kimball. He was a boy in Marchton who
had been Phyllis’ staunchest ally. He would help.
He could set in motion the wheels of their action.
While he studied law in Marchton he could aid
Phyllis. She would write to David tonight!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch11' class='c009'><i>Chapter XI</i><br /> <br />PHYLLIS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Phyllis sat by the window and looked over
the campus. It was the last day of classes
before Thanksgiving. Tomorrow the girls would
be going home for the holiday. But she was going
to stay right here. Her Thanksgiving dinner
would be served here in her room as so many
other meals lately had been. Oh, there would be
other girls in the building, she would not be
alone. But she would feel lonely nevertheless.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale was going home. Phyllis smiled reminiscently.
Gale had been sweet these last weeks and
so had the other girls. They had all been marvelously
good to her—but that, to her, was worse
than if they had quarreled and shouted at her.
If only something would happen to break the
even tenor of her days! If only the girls weren’t
always so sweet, so considerate! They felt sorry
for her, she knew, and it irked her. She was going
to classes again now, studying, but college life
wasn’t the same. There were no extra activities
for her. She could not partake of the basketball
games in which Carol and Janet starred. She
could not join the dancing classes which claimed
all Valerie’s attention. She could not hope to ride
in the spring riding classes to which Ricky and
the others were looking forward so joyfully.</p>

<p class='c008'>She threw her book at the opposite wall with
such vigor that the book bounced back and
landed on the floor with a dull thud. If only
something would happen! She was sick of being
pampered. If they would only treat her as they
had before her accident. They argued with her
then, scolded—anything! Anything but this
eternal sweetness and light! She herself felt anything
but sweet. She was tired of having to be
courageous, always appearing to be cheerful! She
wanted to let out some of the pent-up energy.</p>

<p class='c008'>She looked down upon the campus. Gale and
Valerie with Carol and Janet were coming
toward the sorority house. They seemed to be in
a hurry and kept glancing up at the window
where she sat. She smiled ruefully. At last she
had given them something to stir them. Now
perhaps something would happen—at least, they
wouldn’t change her mind! Phyllis laid her cane
on the floor beside her chair and turned to face
the door. Sunshine Alley was about to have a bit
of a thunderstorm.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We won’t stand for it!” Carol said the second
the door opened.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phyllis merely smiled.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What do you mean by it anyway?” added
Janet.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Just what I said,” Phyllis replied. “I am resigning
as president of the Freshman class.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But why? You must have a reason!” Valerie
put in.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I have a reason,” Phyllis said stubbornly. “I
can’t go to all the class activities, I can’t run
around and be in everything that the president
is supposed to—so I am resigning.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We won’t accept it,” Gale said determinedly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You have to call a meeting of the class and it
will be accepted. It has to be!” Phyllis said.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But, Phyl,” Janet pleaded, “we want you to
be the president. All the girls feel the same.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It wouldn’t be fair to the class,” Phyllis insisted.
“A president is active—she has a lot to do.
Well, I can’t do it so I’m resigning. It is very
simple.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We won’t let you,” Carol said finally. “Val,
you are secretary. Do something about it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I already have,” Valerie said surprisingly. “I
and the Vice President and the Treasurer.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well?” Phyllis said eagerly. “The officers
agreed to accept my resignation, didn’t they?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“They did not,” Valerie said. “We agreed, and
posted a notice in the East Campus Dormitory
to the effect, that you are still our president. Gale
is president pro tem, and any one who disagrees
must see one of us. How does that suit you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You mean Gale is to act in the places where
I can’t?” Phyllis asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>Valerie nodded.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then I’m president in name and Gale does
the work,” Phyllis said. “That isn’t fair.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll love it,” Gale assured her bouncing on the
bed. “That will give me authority. And will I
use it!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That is what I’m afraid of,” Carol grimaced.
“See here, Miss President pro tem, don’t think
you can order me around.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale laughed. “I am going to try. Tonight
there is a party here and you gals can come providing
you go home now and let Phyllis rest.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t want to rest,” Phyllis put in fretfully.
“Stay here and talk to me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Carol looked from Gale to Phyllis.</p>

<p class='c008'>“To go or not to go, that is the question!” misquoted
Janet.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Gale is so hospitable,” laughed Carol.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t know about the rest,” Valerie said,
“but I have to go. The Christmas entertainment
given by the Freshman class is being planned
and the secretary has a lot of work.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“While the president takes things easy,”
Phyllis said bitterly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who is going to sing?” Janet asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” added Carol, “I heard the class is in
need of a good contralto. Who is the star who is
to sing in the chapel?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Valerie shook her head. “Something else to
keep me awake at night. I am on the committee
to put the entertainment over and I haven’t the
faintest idea who we will choose.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How about Phyl?” Gale asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Phyl!” Janet echoed. “Of course! You’ve a
fine voice, Phyl.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Phyllis laughed. “But I won’t be in the entertainment!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“All you have to do is sing,” Carol seconded.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But it is impossible,” Phyllis said. “Me? Sing
in the chapel? Don’t be ridiculous.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I won’t listen to another word,” Phyllis said.
“You don’t know what you are asking.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Phyl, you would——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No!” Phyllis almost shouted. “I would be
scared to death.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale winked at Valerie. “She would be scared
to death, girls,” she murmured. “So that settles
the question. Now will you go home? Go home
and pack your things and get ready to leave tomorrow
morning.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We won’t have time to pack tonight,” added
Janet. “See you tonight for the party,” she added.</p>

<p class='c008'>The early evening was already descending on
the campus and Gale lighted the light.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You didn’t have to chase the girls home,”
Phyllis said peevishly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale said nothing, merely seated herself at her
desk and opened her French book. She did not
try to concentrate her attention on the pages before
her. She was acutely aware of Phyllis moving
about. Gale longed to help Phyllis but she sat
in her place not paying the slightest heed to the
slow and difficult movements of her friend. Suddenly
when Phyllis stumbled and would have
fallen Gale sprang up and saved her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let go!” Phyllis said indignantly. “I can
make it by myself.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Instantly Gale’s arms relaxed. She knew Phyllis
must get used to the difficulties of her movements
now but it was hard to sit by and do
nothing. Gale turned away to her desk again. A
few seconds later she felt Phyllis’ hand on her
shoulder.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sorry, I didn’t mean to snap at you,” Phyllis
said.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is all right,” Gale said.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But it isn’t all right,” Phyllis insisted
stormily. “I snap at you—I snap at all the girls.
It is only because——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know,” Gale said. “But you mustn’t think
about things so much, Phyl. Something will be
done. This may only be for a little while. We’ll
think of a way——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“A way!” Phyllis murmured helplessly. “My
Aunt was here, wasn’t she, and refused to do
anything? She was my only hope.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How did you know?” Gale demanded
sharply.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ricky,” Phyllis said. “She said something
that set me thinking. I asked her point blank and
insisted on her telling me.” She laughed a little.
“Poor Ricky, she tried so hard not to let me
know.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We will do something, Phyl,” Gale assured
her friend more hopefully than she felt. “You’ve
got to make the best of things for a little while.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“A little while!” Phyllis echoed. “It has been
months!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well,” Gale laughed, “if you are looking for
an argument with me you are going to be disappointed.
I refuse to quarrel. I——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Gale!” Phyllis whispered frantically. “The
window! There is a ladder being propped against
it!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale ran to the window and threw it open.
“Someone is climbing up,” she said smiling.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think you know,” Gale laughed.</p>

<p class='c008'>A dark head followed by broad shoulders hove
above the window sill. A laughing voice spoke
out of the November dusk.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hi, Phyl.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“David!” Phyllis cried. “David!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“In person,” he assured her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But how——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I have the Dean’s permission to call on you
properly tonight at eight,” he said laughing, “but
I couldn’t wait. She would probably chase me
out if she could see me now, though. I met Carol
and Janet on the campus a few minutes ago and
they very helpfully suggested this method. It is
effective if startling.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m going down for my dinner,” Gale said
and disappeared.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale had her dinner and then went out on the
campus. She could see David on the ladder and
Phyllis at the window. She waited in the darkness
until she saw David descending the ladder.
She joined him when he was safely on the
ground.</p>

<p class='c008'>“When did you get here, David?” she asked
shaking hands.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This afternoon,” he replied. “I went immediately
to the Dean’s office. I didn’t know
whether I could see Phyllis or not. She is nice,
your Dean.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Staying in the village?” Gale asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes. I’m going to stay until after Thanksgiving,”
he answered. “The Dean said I might
entertain Phyllis while the girls are gone for the
holiday.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“She needs someone,” Gale said. “I’m glad
you’re here, David.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I gathered that,” he said seriously. “She
seems pretty depressed.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Did you see her Aunt?” Gale asked. “You
know I wrote you what she had said and asked
you to see her. Did you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>David shook his head. “She hasn’t been in
Marchton since I received your letter. I went to
the house and asked the woman who cooks for
her when she expected Miss Fields back. She
doesn’t know.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale sighed. “It seems we are balked at every
turn. I intend to find out what it is all about
when I get back to Marchton. If not now, at
Christmas.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll try to keep Phyllis cheered up until you
get back,” David promised.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale returned to the sorority house then. She
had to help Ricky set the stage for their party.
Phyllis would see David again at eight o’clock
while the other girls were upstairs. Gale would
see that they had the living room to themselves
for a long talk. She knew Ricky would aid her if
there was any difficulty in engineering a serene
night for Phyllis.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch12' class='c009'><i>Chapter XII</i><br /> <br />FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Gale tramped through the snow feeling
light-hearted and gay. Snow always seemed
to have such a psychological effect upon her.
Whether it was the lightness of it, or the brightness
of the sun shining on the surface of the snow
she did not know. At any rate she felt at ease
with the world.</p>

<p class='c008'>College had resumed at high speed for the
short time between Thanksgiving and Christmas.
Now it was but a week until the Christmas holidays.
Gale felt joyfully elated. Last night she
and Phyllis had carefully wrapped Christmas
presents and hidden them in their trunks. There
was a spirit of excitement in the air. The girls
went about with mysterious bundles and smiles.</p>

<p class='c008'>Even Phyllis seemed to be nearly back to her
old cheerful spirits. Ever since Thanksgiving
when David had appeared at the college Phyllis
was happier, calmer. Gale was glad. She had had
absolutely no success in Marchton. Miss Fields
had not been at home. It had been as David said.
No one knew where she had gone or when she
was coming back.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale ran lightly up the steps and disappeared
into the Dean’s office. The Dean’s secretary was
absent so Gale knocked on the door to the inner
sanctum where the Dean had her private office.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come in.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale opened the door and stepped within.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Gale.” The Dean looked up. She was just
slipping into her coat. “Be seated. I want to mail
this letter. It must get off immediately.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll mail it for you,” Gale offered.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, I’ll drop it myself. It will only take a
moment. Wait for me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale looked about the empty office. There was
a typewriter next to the Dean’s desk. Her
curiosity getting the better of her Gale inserted a
sheet and typed a few words. It was not the
smoothness or noiselessness of the machine that
attracted her, but the letters themselves. The
letters were even, in perfect alignment, all but
the R. That was slightly raised. Gale could
scarcely believe her eyes. She jerked the paper
from the machine and brought the old mysterious
note from her pocket. There was no question
about it! The two had been written on the
same machine! But it was impossible—incredible!</p>

<p class='c008'>The Dean had not sent them that note, had
she? Certainly not! But who then? Her secretary?
Gale looked dubious. There was more in
this situation than she had guessed. That she
decided before—but now! How had this note
been written on the Dean’s typewriter? She put
both sheets of paper into her pocket again as
she heard footsteps in the outer office.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now, Gale, what is it?” The Dean removed
her coat and seated herself behind her desk.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Phyllis. She has decided she doesn’t want to
go home for Christmas. She would rather stay
here. David, Mr. Kimball, wants to come to
Briarhurst again and see Phyllis over the holidays.”
Gale drummed lightly on the space bar
of the typewriter. “A nice typewriter, Dean. Just
new?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, my secretary bought it yesterday.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Yesterday! Gale added that to the storehouse
of facts in her mind. Yesterday! Yet she was sure
the mysterious note had been written on it
months before! She scarcely heard the Dean’s
permission for David to come to Briarhurst as
he had done on Thanksgiving, so busy was she
turning over this new development.</p>

<p class='c008'>Her business with the Dean concluded, Gale
left. She had dinner with Janet and Carol at the
East Campus Dormitory and after that they all
went to the chapel to hear the Freshman’s
musical Christmas entertainment.</p>

<p class='c008'>The organ was playing when the girls entered.
The chapel was decorated with holly and
poinsettias. In the corner a mammoth Christmas
tree with the traditional white star at the top
sent out a fragrance of spruce and Christmas
cheer.</p>

<p class='c008'>The girls sang carols and there were several
solos. But the best liked soloist was a mystery.
From the region of the organ, behind the holly
and spruce display, came a girl’s voice. The
others listened spellbound. Such richness and expression!
Every note was as clear as a bell. The
music rang through the chapel and brought a
new understanding and appreciation of Christmas
to the listeners.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who is it?” Janet was simply bursting with
curiosity.</p>

<p class='c008'>“She is superb!” Gale echoed. “I never heard a
voice like that.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Valerie was sitting beside them, the smile of
sweet satisfaction on her face a mystery.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You were on the committee, Val, who is it?”
Carol coaxed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is a secret,” Valerie said. “But isn’t she
fine?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wonderful,” Gale agreed. “I wish Phyllis
could hear her.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why didn’t Phyllis come?” Madge whispered.</p>

<p class='c008'>“She said she was too tired.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Shshshsh,” Janet warned as the soloist began
again. “I could listen to her for hours. Is she
somebody from the college, Val?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course,” Valerie nodded.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, if I only had a voice like that!” Carol
sighed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then you would get some place,” Janet
agreed. “That girl will be famous.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Valerie smiled to herself.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the quiet, musical evening was over the
girls voted it a huge success. They doubted if
even the play on the next night could hold them
as enthralled. The Juniors and Seniors who had
been present were quite as enthusiastic.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We want that singer in the Glee Club,” Adele
Stevens said firmly. She was the active president
of the organization and she did not intend to
miss adding such a fine voice to the group.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t know,” Valerie said dubiously. “We
had a hard time persuading her to sing tonight.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But why didn’t she come out from behind the
shrubbery?” Carol complained. “We want to
know what she looks like.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Shrubbery!” Janet said horrified. “Carol
Carter! To call our decorations that after the
time we had arranging them!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sorry,” Carol laughed. “Who put the star on
the top of the tree?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Madge,” Janet giggled, “and she almost
pulled the tree over a half dozen times.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The girls paused in front of the sorority house.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Perhaps we shouldn’t come in if Phyllis is
tired,” Janet said.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come along,” Valerie said lightly. “She can
bear it this once. No one should be tired around
Christmas time.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The girls trouped up the stairs singing as they
went. They found Phyllis sitting at her desk, her
cheeks flushed and eyes bright.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Greetings, my little sugar plum,” Carol said
lavishly. “You don’t know what you missed tonight.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What?” Phyllis asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“A singer—and what a singer! Honestly, that
girl could be the musical sensation of the year.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Valerie and Phyllis exchanged glances then
they both started to laugh.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s so funny?” Janet demanded.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Either you girls are awf’ly innocent or you
haven’t the brains I thought you had,” Valerie
said between laughs. “Don’t you see? Phyllis was
the singer. She was the soloist tonight.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Phyllis!” Gale echoed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Janet and Carol howled together: “And you
never told us!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“A fine pal you are!” Janet grumbled.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m disgusted with you,” added Carol. “Hiding
a voice like that! We knew you were good—but
never that good!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I didn’t want to do it,” Phyllis confessed.
“But Valerie said I didn’t have to appear before
all of you. No one would know who I was. I
thought it would be fun to surprise you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You certainly did,” Carol declared. “So much
so that Adele Stevens wants you in the Glee
Club.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Never more can you be the shrinking violet,”
Janet nodded. “Now you will blossom forth in
notes of song and we shall see you never more.
Ah, me, such is the price of fame.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wait a minute,” Phyllis laughed. “I sang tonight
but that was only because Val wouldn’t
give me a moment’s peace, otherwise. I don’t intend
to join the Glee Club.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It would be good for you,” Gale said. “You’ve
always liked music, Phyl.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Phyllis yawned. “But now I believe I would
like bed better.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Just a gentle hint,” Carol chaffed. “It seems
we are always getting put out of here.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You shouldn’t come at such late hours then,”
Phyllis said.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Tell me,” Janet said, “since you are surprising
us, you aren’t going to be Santa Claus in the
play tomorrow night, are you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Phyllis giggled. “Hardly!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course not,” Carol said indignantly. “She
hasn’t got a beard.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale opened the window. Voices drifted up on
the night air. The sorority girls were just ending
their sorority song.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“We link our hands in friendship,</div>
      <div class='line'>The girls of Omega Chi.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“I hope we get elected to the sorority,” Carol
said. “Then perhaps we can move in here with
you next term.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We aren’t even members,” Gale reminded
them. “We are here only on the recommendation
of Miss Relso. If she hadn’t written for us we
would never have gotten rooms in Happiness
House.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“If we aren’t elected to the sorority in May we
will have to move,” Phyllis added.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s that?” Carol shrieked as she backed
away from the window.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Two eyes—staring in at me out of the darkness,”
she pointed to the window.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phyllis and Gale laughed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Only an owl in the tree out there,” Phyllis
said. “He is often there at night.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why don’t owls sleep at night?” Janet
wanted to know. “Are they afraid to sleep in the
dark?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And do deers ever blow their horns?” Carol
questioned. “We better go to our own domicile,”
she added at the dark glances from her friends.
“Au revoir, ma chérie,” she murmured in her
very best French.</p>

<p class='c008'>From the window Gale and Phyllis watched
the girls disappear in the direction of the East
Campus Dormitory.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You were wonderful tonight, Phyl,” Gale declared
earnestly. “And were we surprised! When
did you decide to sing?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Valerie talked me into it,” Phyllis laughed.
“She said I should do something like that—so I
would have a part in the Christmas celebration
I really enjoyed it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Phyllis—are you sure you won’t go home
with me for Christmas?” Gale asked sitting on
the bed beside Phyllis. “I would love to have
you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Phyllis shook her head. “No. I can’t go to my
Aunt’s place—I could but I don’t want to, so I’ll
stay here. Besides,” she said, eyes twinkling,
“David is coming. I won’t be lonesome.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That reminds me,” Gale said, “I meant to tell
the other girls, too. Tonight when I went to the
Dean’s office I had to wait a while for her. While
I was waiting I tried her typewriter. Guess what
I discovered!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Our mysterious note was typed on her
machine. What do you deduct from that? I
didn’t tell her because I wanted to think about
it for a while. It seems strange.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Her own typewriter!” Phyllis echoed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And she told me she bought the typewriter
only yesterday!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It can’t be,” Phyllis frowned. “There is something
wrong someplace. Whom did she buy the
typewriter from?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“She said her secretary bought it,” Gale said
slowly. “I wonder if her secretary is everything
she should be?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Certainly she wouldn’t eat candy she knew
was poisoned,” Phyllis said. “She was sick from
it, remember.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“If it was poisoned.” Gale ran slim fingers
through her hair. “The whole thing is beyond me.
I’m not such a master mind after all.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We will let it wait until after Christmas,”
Phyllis said.</p>

<p class='c008'>The girls were forced to do that. Nothing more
could be discovered at present and there was too
much excitement with the holidays to bother
about it.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch13' class='c009'><i>Chapter XIII</i><br /> <br />STARTLING NEWS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Gale opened one eye and peered at the clock.
The next instant she was up and hurriedly
dashing through her usually methodical routine
of dressing. It was Christmas morning. She was
home with her parents and Brent was here! Last
night had been the most glorious Christmas Eve
she had ever experienced. The Adventure Girls,
with the exception of Phyllis of course, and
Brent and the other boys had gone carolling.
After that there had been sandwiches and hot
chocolate in the Howard living room where they
could admire the big Christmas tree. Then, when
the others had gone, a long intimate talk with
Brent, learning all about his work in Washington
and telling him all about her college life.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now she pictured Brent waiting downstairs
and, important enough too, a lot of mysterious
packages beneath the Christmas tree just waiting
to be opened. With a final approving look
at the laughing, gray-eyed girl in the mirror, Gale
dashed out into the hallway. With a cheer she
slid down the banister and landed right in
Brent’s arms.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Merry Christmas!” she said gaily.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Merry Christmas yourself. Your Dad and I
had about decided you were going to sleep all
day.” He tucked her arm within his. “How
about some breakfast? I’m famished!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Before we open our presents?” she demanded.
“I should say not!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Saint Nicholas had been more than generous
in his gifts to Gale and the others. After a long
time spent examining and exclaiming over what
the boxes disclosed they went to church. Then a
long walk home through the brilliant sunlight
and a most satisfying dinner.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You know,” Gale confessed to Brent, “I keep
thinking about Phyllis. I told you what her Aunt
said that day, didn’t I? Let’s go see Miss Fields.
I want to ask her what she meant—if she is
home.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“As you say,” Brent agreed.</p>

<p class='c008'>The two walked up the long hill arm in arm.
The air was cold and invigorating. Gale felt she
must burst with personal happiness yet she
found time to think of Phyllis and wish, as
often before, that there was something she could
do.</p>

<p class='c008'>The house on the hill was gray and silent, just
as she had pictured it when she was at Briarhurst.
The shutters were closed on most of the
windows and there was a forlorn, deserted look
about the place.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think you will be disappointed,” Brent said.
“It looks as though it is closed up for the
winter.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I hope she is here,” Gale said.</p>

<p class='c008'>Brent used the old iron knocker vigorously.
They could hear the sound echo in the room
beyond. They waited several minutes before
Brent knocked again. To their surprise the door
was opened almost immediately and by Miss
Fields herself.</p>

<p class='c008'>“H-Hello,” Gale began uncertainly. “I want to
talk to you, Miss Fields.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m sorry, I’m busy,” the woman said.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ve got to talk to you!” Gale insisted. “About
Phyllis.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Grudgingly the woman opened the door farther
and Gale took advantage of it to slip within.
Brent followed and then there was nothing for
Miss Fields to do but lead the way into the cold,
dark front room.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale shivered as she sat on the edge of an old-fashioned
stuffed sofa beside Brent. This was a
terrible place, so cold and damp and dark. She
wagered no sunlight had been inside the house
since Miss Fields took residence there, and that
was years and years. Brent reached over and
took Gale’s hand in his warm grasp. It seemed
to be what she needed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well?” Miss Fields’ voice was frigid and she
sat stiffly in her chair.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I—that is——” Gale began lamely. “We, the
girls, are anxious to help Phyllis all we can. We
can’t do it without your aid.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well?” Miss Fields repeated.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We want to know why you won’t help,” Gale
said quickly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Miss Fields grew even more frigid if that were
possible. She regarded Gale with the utmost disdain
and Gale was glad of Brent’s presence. She
felt she would have withered away under such a
glare if she had been alone.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I told you that day at Briarhurst it was impossible,”
she said.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know,” Gale agreed, “but we want to know
why. You must think we are impertinent, but you
see we think an awful lot of Phyllis. Something
must be done.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It will do you no good to question me,” Miss
Fields returned. “If that is all I will wish you
good day.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wait!” Gale cried when the woman would
have left them.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You have no right to make Phyllis suffer because of
a promise you made years ago. She can
be cured and you can help! There is no promise
important enough to stop that!”</p>

<p class='c008'>A cool glance was all the reply she got.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’ve got to help Phyllis,” Gale insisted
doggedly. She took a deep breath and looked at
the woman almost pityingly. “I had no idea anyone
could be so hard-hearted—so unfeeling! No
wonder Phyllis hates you!”</p>

<p class='c008'>To the utter amazement and consternation of
Gale and Brent, Phyllis’ Aunt sank into a chair
and covered her face with her hands.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know she hates me,” Miss Fields said in a
dry whisper, “but I’d do anything for her.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale looked at Brent and he looked at her.
Was she hearing aright? Was this the cold stern
woman whom they had always accused of having
no feeling whatever—of being cruel to Phyllis?
It seemed Gale’s words had released a spring of
words that had been harbored too long.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ve raised Phyllis since she was two years
old. I’ve never meant to be cruel but I’ve been
afraid I would lose her,” Miss Fields continued
staring at the floor. “I was jealous and afraid of
the friends she made—it seemed to take a part
of her away from me. I wanted to know what she
was doing—I wanted her to love me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale refrained from commenting on the fact
that Miss Fields had taken a mighty strange
manner of showing her love for Phyllis. She listened
incredibly to the story of this strange
lonely woman who had raised Phyllis. It was a
cry of a heart which had at last broken through
the cast of steel and ice which had so long encased
it. It was hard to believe that Miss Fields
really possessed a genuine affection for Phyllis.
But, Gale admitted slowly to herself, it might be
possible for one, such as Miss Fields, to want to
have Phyllis’ affection solely for herself, to be
jealous of the girl’s outside activities and friends
because it meant a branch of life in which she
could not share. She had overlooked, in her blind
striving for all of Phyllis’ companionship, the
girl’s craving for friends her own age and the
other interests of younger people.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I realize what this—this accident has meant
to her,” Miss Fields assured them. “I would help—I’ve
tried to think of a way—but I can’t. My
hands are tied.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Brent leaned forward and spoke for the first
time.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Phyllis is not really your niece, is she, Miss
Fields?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale looked at him in surprise. This was a new
angle! Phyllis not really Miss Fields’ niece?
What did he mean?</p>

<p class='c008'>Miss Fields stared at Brent. Her eyes had the
hunted look of an animal caught in a trap.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What do you mean?” she asked fearfully.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You might as well tell us everything,” Brent
pursued kindly. “We only want to help
straighten matters out. Phyllis isn’t really your
niece, is she?” he insisted.</p>

<p class='c008'>Miss Fields looked down at her hands clasped
together tightly in her lap. Finally she raised her
head.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No,” she said.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I thought so,” Brent murmured. “You had
better tell us about everything. All about what
happened years ago——”</p>

<p class='c008'>Miss Fields fixed her eyes on the opposite wall
and started to speak. It was as if she had forgotten
the young people to whom she was talking,
merely repeating a story that had been
lodged in her mind for years.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Years ago I was secretary to a Doctor. He
had a wife and a little girl. One day his wife was
killed in a bad railroad accident. Before she died
she made me promise to stay with Phyllis. The
Doctor was heart-broken and partly to forget,
partly to further his ambition, he decided to go
to Europe to study surgery. He left his little
girl with me and enough money to keep her until
he should return and longer.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Didn’t he ever return?” Gale asked anxiously.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I lived in his house with Phyllis for two years.
Then one day I received a wire that he was returning.
I thought of all sorts of things—that I
might be discharged—I might never see Phyllis
again. I was lonely—I had no family, and I had
grown to love the little girl like my own
daughter.” She looked sadly at Gale. “I brought
Phyllis here. I’ve hidden her all these years——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Her father?” Gale asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>Miss Fields bowed her head. “He returned to
Europe after a few years—when he didn’t find
us. I’ve always been afraid someone would discover
who she was—that is why I didn’t want
Phyllis to make friends—I was afraid. Now you
know everything—what do you propose to do?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale looked speechlessly at Brent. Her head
was whirling with the new discovery. What a
story had been here in their midst! Phyllis was
the heroine of a story as incredible and fantastic
as any fiction. What were they to do first?</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who is her father?” Brent asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>Miss Fields looked at him silently for a long
moment. “Doctor Philip Elton,” she said finally.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The famous surgeon?” Brent echoed in surprise.</p>

<p class='c008'>Miss Fields nodded. “But no one knows where
he is. When I learned Phyllis needed money for
an operation I tried to get in touch with him. I
was willing then to let him know about Phyllis
because I couldn’t help her any more—but he
could. It was impossible. He is somewhere in
Europe.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ve got to find him,” Gale said excitedly.
“Think what it means to Phyl——”</p>

<p class='c008'>Brent rose. “We will start a search immediately.
When he is found he can decide what
is to be done,” he told Miss Fields.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale and Brent went out into the sunshine
leaving the woman sitting alone in the cold forlorn
house.</p>

<p class='c008'>“To think of all that being hidden for years
and years,” she murmured as they walked toward
her home. “Because Miss Fields was so selfish.
She didn’t think what it might mean to
Phyllis——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll start the search for Doctor Elton,” Brent
planned. “I suppose David will want to help
when he returns.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you think we should tell Phyllis now?”
Gale asked. “Or do you think it would be better
to wait until her father is found?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Perhaps it would be wiser to wait a little
while,” Brent agreed.</p>

<p class='c008'>They reached Gale’s home and entered the
warm living room.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why don’t you take your overcoat off?” Gale
asked. “You are going to stay a while, aren’t
you?” she continued humorously.</p>

<p class='c008'>Brent shook his head. “No. I’m flying back to
Washington this afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Brent!” she wailed. “You didn’t tell me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wanted it to be the happiest sort of Christmas,”
he replied. “Some day you will be going
with me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Some day,” she agreed.</p>

<p class='c008'>When Brent had gone Gale curled up in the
corner of the divan and watched the flames of
the fire in the fireplace. She let her dreams run
rampant. Some day she would be flying to Washington
with Brent. She remembered what a thrill
it had been flying to Canada with him last year.
She remembered, too, the night of the Senior
Prom when she and Brent had strolled in the
garden.</p>

<p class='c008'>But even over-riding all her rosy dreams was
the astounding news she had heard about Phyllis
that afternoon. It was like a fantastic fairy story.
To think that Phyllis was the daughter of a
famous surgeon, really a wealthy girl who had
been hidden away in this small town all these
years by a strange, selfish woman who claimed
affection for the girl. Think what it must have
meant to Phyllis’ father—to return to his home
to find the woman, whom he had entrusted with
the care of his little girl, had disappeared taking
his daughter with her. It must have been heart-breaking!
But think what a reunion there would
be when they met now—after all these years!
How would Phyllis receive the news?</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale pictured all sorts of ways to bring Phyllis
and her father together yet the one which
actually was to happen was even more dramatic.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale went to the telephone and put a long distance
call through to Briarhurst. A few minutes
later she heard Phyllis’ voice.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Merry Christmas!” Gale said gaily. “How
are you? What did you do with yourself?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“David hired a sleigh drawn by two horses
and we had a long ride in the country,” Phyllis
said happily. “It was glorious.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They talked for a few moments and then Gale
hung up, feeling satisfied that Phyllis had really
enjoyed her Christmas after all. She had said
nothing of her interview with Miss Fields, that
would come later. Gale even doubted if she
would tell the other Adventure Girls yet. It
would be a secret between herself and Brent and
David until Doctor Elton was found and could
be produced.</p>

<p class='c008'>She went back to her position before the fire.
In ten days she would be going back to college.
Then to pick up the threads of mystery concerning
the Dean. This would be the spring term. Her
riding lessons would start and she was anxious
for them. Her only regret was that Phyllis would
not be able to join her. Perhaps if her father was
found and there was an operation performed
Phyllis would eventually be as active as she had
been. But not now!</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale opened a book and nibbled on a chocolate
caramel. She was perfectly content with her
present position. A book was always a treasured
companion to her. She could find much delight
in following the adventures of a printed hero and
heroine. Their adventures were always more dangerous,
more glamorous than events in real life.</p>

<p class='c008'>But alas, her composure and peace were not to
last. There arose a loud clatter outside and the
doorbell pealed long and loudly. Gale resignedly,
smilingly, closed her book. Only the Adventure
Girls would make so much noise.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch14' class='c009'><i>Chapter XIV</i><br /> <br />DISCOVERED</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“Look!” Carol pirouetted gracefully for the
benefit of her friends.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m speechless,” Janet said appreciatively.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wait until I get my sun glasses,” pleaded
Phyllis. “I’m dazzled.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Carol was arrayed in the scarlet lounging
pajamas she had received for a Christmas
present. The Adventure Girls were all gathered
in her and Janet’s room viewing the display with
mingled exclamations.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And wait——” Carol murmured diving into
the closet.</p>

<p class='c008'>“More to come,” Madge said shaking her head.
“If it is as terrific as those pajamas, don’t show
it to me. My nerves won’t stand it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“My riding habit,” Carol said proudly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Janet laughed. “All you need now is the
horse.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ve heard they have a merry-go-round in the
next village park,” Valerie put in. “Perhaps they
would let you practice there.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Carol made a little face at her. “Just the same,
I am all prepared.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What time is it?” Phyllis asked suddenly.
“Heavens! I have to go. I promised Adele to go
with her to the Glee Club meeting this afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ah, our singer is blossoming out,” Janet said
gleefully. “What did I tell you!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll go with you,” Gale said. “I have to see
Professor Lukens about our Chemistry assignment
tomorrow.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The two girls went down to the campus. Gale
saw Phyllis safely to the Glee Club meeting before
she went on to the Chemistry Hall. The
corridors and rooms were for the most part
empty. She went to the classroom where the Professor
often spent his afternoons going over
papers. He was not there so Gale went on to the
laboratory.</p>

<p class='c008'>At the door she drew back hastily into the
corridor. Someone was in the room but it was
not the Professor. It was Miss Horton, the
Dean’s secretary, and the girl was fussing with
the lock on the cabinet where the experimental
materials were kept. Gale watched her cautiously
through a crack in the door. The glass doors were
suddenly opened. A small glass vial found its
way from the closet into the pocket of the girl’s
coat.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale turned and fled down the hall. Outside
she waited. Miss Horton came out. With a glance
about she hurried down the steps and set off in
the direction of the Dean’s office. Gale followed,
hurrying her steps to keep the girl in sight. At
the corner of the building Gale bumped into
Valerie.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Going to a fire?” Valerie asked. “Say, Gale,
do you know where I can find——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Can’t stop now,” Gale said. “Val, something
is going to happen. Find Doctor Norcot. Bring
her to the Dean’s office right away. Hurry!” Gale
urged when Valerie hesitated.</p>

<p class='c008'>Valerie broke into a run. Gale hurried on her
way. Miss Horton was disappearing into the
building. Gale followed and it was not until she
was in the building that she realized she had no
definite idea at all why she was so alarmed. True,
it was strange that Miss Horton should break
into the Chemistry cabinet and take something—Gale
wasn’t sure what. Could it have been
Miss Horton who hurled that acid out the window
at the Dean so many weeks ago? Could it
have been Miss Horton who wrote that mysterious
note to the girls? Could she have cut the
rope to set Dean Travis’ canoe afloat?</p>

<p class='c008'>Yes, all those things were quite possible. But
what was she up to now? There were a lot of
things in that Chemistry cabinet—things which
in the wrong hands could cause a lot of damage.</p>

<p class='c008'>On tiptoe Gale approached the door to the
outer office. Miss Horton was stirring a white
liquid in a glass. On her desk was the discarded
vial from the Chemistry laboratory—empty!
The contents had been put into the glass with
something else. Gale watched the silent actions
of the girl within the room. Miss Horton was
nervous, erratic, in her movements. She appeared
slightly crazed with an inner obsession. The telephone
rang, the bell startling both Gale and the
girl inside.</p>

<p class='c008'>Miss Horton stared at the instrument for a
moment then picked up the receiver. She sank
into her desk chair.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sarah! Why did you call? Of course I’m all
right. Don’t worry. Do you understand? Don’t
worry! And Sarah—you will be Dean of Briarhurst
someday.”</p>

<p class='c008'>With those words Miss Horton replaced the
receiver. She looked about the room and stood
up. Grasping the glass again she walked toward
the Dean’s office. She opened the door and spoke.
Gale could clearly hear her words.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This will help your headache, Dean Travis.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale lost no time. She dashed wildly into the
office, knocking the glass from the Dean’s upraised
hand, thinking at the same time what
would happen if she was wrong in her suspicions!</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t drink it!” she cried.</p>

<p class='c008'>The glass crashed to the floor and made a dark
stain on the carpet. Miss Horton gazed at Gale in
horror, shrinking toward the door.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Gale! What does this mean?” the Dean
gasped.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It means Miss Horton broke into the
Chemistry laboratory and took a vial—poison
probably. She mixed it in that glass,” Gale continued
accusingly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is this true?” the Dean asked, looking from
Gale to her now sobbing secretary.</p>

<p class='c008'>The girl did not answer. Doctor Norcot and
Valerie appeared in the doorway.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What is going on?” the Doctor demanded
breathlessly. She held up the empty vial which
had been on the secretary’s desk. “Whom does
this belong to?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Gale——” Valerie said in mystification.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is all right now,” Gale said, “Miss Horton
almost poisoned the Dean. I followed her here
from the Chemistry laboratory.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, I meant to poison her,” Miss Horton
said desperately, hysterically. “If it hadn’t been
for her my sister would be Dean of Briarhurst.
She worked years to have the position, she
studied in Europe, everything to fit herself for
this. Then you came along,” the girl said to Dean
Travis, “and were appointed. It nearly broke my
sister’s heart.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You thought if you could get rid of me your
sister would still have a chance,” Dean Travis
said slowly. “Is that it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes. Now I’ve failed. You might as well
know, I took the money from your safe, too. I
meant to put it back—but I couldn’t right away.
Now you will probably send me to prison.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The Dean smiled in sympathetic understanding.
“No, but if you return the money, pack your
things and leave tonight, we will forget the whole
incident.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now,” Valerie pounced upon Gale when they
were outside. “Tell me what happened? It was
all a mystery to me yet you seemed to know all
about things.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Simple,” Gale grinned. “Miss Horton’s sister
wanted to be Dean at the same time as Dean
Travis. You know who won. Miss Horton evidently
sought revenge for her sister. She was
doing these things to frighten Dean Travis into
leaving. Once she left, Miss Horton’s sister stood
a good chance of being appointed in her place.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But Dean Travis didn’t scare so easily, is
that it?” Valerie asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Right,” Gale agreed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“So Miss Horton was going to murder the
Dean,” Valerie shivered. “How horrible!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“She didn’t really know what she was doing,”
Gale said.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And the Dean forgave her as if it were nothing
at all,” Valerie said. “Attempted murder is a
criminal offense.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Miss Horton was too scared to ever do anything
like it again,” Gale said. “There was no use
punishing her farther. After all, no harm was
actually done.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You forget the note and the mysterious man
that night back of the Chemistry Hall,” Valerie
reminded her. “And what of Phyl’s accident? Did
someone push the lumber that day?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That we will probably never know—about
the man I mean,” Gale said. “She must have had
someone with her. But I think she wrote the note.
As for the lumber that caught Phyllis, I believe
that really was an accident.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Will the girls be surprised!” Valerie said.
“Anyway, I’m glad I was in at the finish.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The girls were gathered in the living room of
the sorority house. One of the Seniors had a small
radio and she was fussing with it while the rest
listened and idled away the time until dinner.
Just as Gale entered and joined Phyllis and
Ricky a voice from the radio proclaimed:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Flash! An unconfirmed report has just been
received that Doctor Philip Elton, the world renowned
surgeon, is lost in the jungles of Brazil.
Doctor Elton sailed from Liverpool, England, a
month ago for a vacation cruise on his yacht, the
<em>Tornado</em>.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Some fun,” Ricky commented. “I’ve heard all
sorts of things about those jungles.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is he any relation to you?” Valerie asked of
Phyllis smilingly. “Same name.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale held her breath until Phyllis had replied.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not that I know of,” Phyllis laughed. “No relation
of mine is fortunate enough to own a
yacht.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale moved away. If she stayed with the girls
another minute she would tell them the truth or
burst!</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hi, Gale!” A voice called. “Telephone!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale shut the door to the small closet-like room
which the girls had converted into a telephone
booth.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hello? Yes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>It was Brent.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Brent, I just heard the news about Doctor
Elton. Phyllis heard it, too, and she doesn’t suspect
a thing.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I called to tell you,” Brent said. “David and
I are flying down tonight. The South American
government is sending out a searching party and
we want to help.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Take care,” Gale pleaded. “The jungle is so
dangerous.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who was it?” Ricky demanded, when Gale
emerged.</p>

<p class='c008'>Luckily the dinner summons saved Gale the
necessity of an explanation. After dinner the girls
retreated to their rooms to devote much needed
time to their studies.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale looked up from her books to Phyllis.
Phyllis was bent over a mathematics problem;
her cane lay beside her chair and she looked very
tired.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you ever hear from Miss Fields, Phyllis?”
Gale asked suddenly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phyllis looked up in surprise. “She sends me a
monthly allowance. That is all, why?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wondered. Did you always live with her,
Phyl?” Gale continued slowly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I can’t remember anyone else,” Phyllis said.
“Very faintly I recall a big house and a dog. We
used to have grand times together. But I never
had a dog in Marchton,” she said, “so perhaps it
is all a dream.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is Miss Fields your mother’s or your father’s
sister?” Gale asked next. She knew the woman
was neither, but she wanted to have Phyllis’
thought on the subject.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phyllis twirled her pencil between her fingers.
“Perhaps you will think I’m funny, but sometimes
I think she isn’t even my Aunt.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why?” Gale asked intently.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phyllis shrugged her shoulders. “I can’t explain
it. The feeling is just there. She never speaks
about any of those things.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hmmm,” Gale said.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But this isn’t getting my mathematics done,”
Phyllis sighed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nor my Latin,” Gale agreed.</p>

<p class='c008'>The girls resumed their studies, but Gale’s
mind insisted on wandering off to picture an airplane
bearing two young men toward South
America. David and Brent were off to aid in the
search for the famous surgeon—Phyllis’ father!
What if the Doctor wasn’t found? Gale looked
across at Phyllis. Practically all of Phyllis’ future
hinged on the news announcement they had
heard downstairs and the girl did not know it!</p>

<p class='c008'>“What are you going to do after college, Phyl?”
Gale asked dreamily.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phyllis laughed. “What’s the matter, isn’t the
Latin interesting?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Terribly,” Gale smiled. “But what are you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I haven’t the faintest idea,” Phyllis confessed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Neither have I,” Gale admitted, “unless it is
to be a doctor. Anyway, you can go back to your
mathematics.” She turned her attention to her
book again, but she couldn’t concentrate on it.
She wandered out of their room and downstairs.
She found the Senior still at her radio listening
to a popular comedian.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Any more news flashes?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nope.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale went back upstairs. She was restless. She
wished she was with Brent and David. It was
hard to wait for news. It was so much better to
be in the center of the activity. But now it was
doubly hard for her because she was the only one
here who knew about Phyllis’ father. If there was
only someone she could talk it over with! But it
was to be a secret and she would keep it. Still,
sometimes she felt she must tell Phyllis that
things would be brighter for her.</p>

<p class='c008'>For days Gale’s suspense continued. She attended
classes, basketball games, club meetings,
and every afternoon walked to the little village
for an evening paper. There was very little news
printed about Doctor Elton and his trip into the
Brazilian jungle. Neither did Gale receive any
word from Brent. She had not heard a thing since
the night he telephoned her. Now she had an additional
worry. Not only was she concerned about
Doctor Elton, but more so about Brent’s safety.</p>

<p class='c008'>Day after day she scanned the newspapers, listened
to news reports on the Seniors’ radio and
looked for a letter, but none of them yielded the
news she hoped for. She tried to conceal all
anxiety from Phyllis and the other Adventure
Girls, but she wasn’t very successful. They could
not help but notice her sudden absorptions in
newspapers and the radio. However, try as they
would, they could not drag forth any explanation.
Gale laughed all their questions aside.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then one day came a thick letter from Brent.
Gale received it in the living room and raced to
the privacy of the girls’ sanctum to read it. Lying
on the bed, her chin propped on her hands, the
letter against the pillow, Gale read it through
once and then again. She rolled over on her back
and stared at the ceiling.</p>

<p class='c008'>Doctor Elton was found and Brent and David
were flying him to Briarhurst. They would arrive
on the seventeenth. This was already the fifteenth!
They had told the Doctor Phyllis’ story—also
that she was his daughter. Brent said very
little of what a revelation it must have been to
the Doctor. She searched out a particular paragraph
again.</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘Doctor Elton is willing to perform Phyllis’
operation himself, but she is not to know until
afterward that he is her father. Why he makes
that reservation I do not know—unless it would
be more of a trial and an ordeal for her knowing
who he was. So, Gale, dear, it is up to you to get
Phyllis ready to meet the Doctor. He wants to do
things right away.’”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why so deep in thought?” Phyllis asked, when
she entered.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Phyllis——” Gale sat up. “Phyl, suppose you
had the chance to have the operation that might
make you all right again, would you go through
with it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Phyllis grew a little pale.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Just that,” Gale pursued. “Suppose the biggest
doctor in the country said you had a chance—a
very good chance, if your leg was operated
on and reset, of walking again as you used to.
Would you take it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Would I take it?” Phyllis gasped incredulously.
“Oh, Gale, need you ask? I’d take any
sort of chance—even the slimmest.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It means weeks again of convalescence—time
in the hospital,” Gale reminded her gently.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But it would be worth it,” Phyllis said. “Gale,
tell me what you mean!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale hugged Phyllis rapturously. “It means,
Phyl, that Doctor Elton, the surgeon, is coming
to Briarhurst to see you. He is going to perform
it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“When?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He arrives day after tomorrow.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But the money?”</p>

<p class='c008'>That momentarily stumped Gale.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He is interested in you,” Gale explained
lamely. “Brent met him and was telling him about
you and he——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“An experiment, is that it?” Phyllis asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Um—ah—sort of,” Gale agreed. “But think
what it will mean, Phyl! You’ll even be back on
the hockey team next year,” she added gayly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who will be on what hockey team?” Valerie
asked, entering. “Greetings, Madam President
and Madam Pro Tem. What did I interrupt?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Phyllis breathlessly told her and went off happily
to tell Ricky.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How come, Gale?” Valerie asked, mystified.
“To have Doctor Elton, THE Doctor Elton——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is a long story,” Gale said, swallowing a
lump in her throat. “I’ll tell you sometime, Val,
but the main thing now is Phyllis—she is so
happy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is going to take a lot of courage to go
through it all again,” Val said. “I suppose there
is no doubt about the success of the operation?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“If Doctor Elton can’t do it, it can’t be done,”
Gale said firmly. “He is the best, Val. Besides
that, he is her——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Her what?” Valerie asked interestedly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nothing,” Gale said hastily. “Here comes
Phyl. Let’s go tell Doctor Norcot and Dean
Travis now,” she proposed.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch15' class='c009'><i>Chapter XV</i><br /> <br />PHYLLIS’ STORY</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Gale leaned her hot cheek against the coolness
of the window pane.</p>

<p class='c008'>The rain beating against the outside tinkled
in her ear. She closed her eyes and swallowed
a big yawn. From her position she could
see the small town of Weston spread out before
her. Lamps gleamed yellow gold, reflected
on the shining wetness of the streets. Automobiles
crawled past like bugs on a sheet of black
paper.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you suppose he will ever come out?” Gale
asked wearily.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It has been three hours,” Valerie sighed. “It
will scarcely be much longer.”</p>

<p class='c008'>David paced up and down the waiting room
while Brent sprawled lazily in a leather chair and
stared at the ceiling. The girls turned from the
window and contemplated the room. They had
come there early in the afternoon with Phyllis
and Brent and David. At the hospital, for the
first time they met Doctor Elton. He was a
middle-aged man, good looking and dignified.
Gale could see a strong resemblance between
Phyllis and her father. The Doctor had immediately
taken Phyllis away with him, being professionally
kind, but not at all fatherish as Gale
had remarked to Brent.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That will come later,” Brent told her.</p>

<p class='c008'>The four of them had elected to wait until the
operation was over. They had not seen Phyllis
again. Now it was long past their dinner time and
they were waiting for Doctor Elton to tell them
of the success or failure of his work.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale argued with herself that there could be
no thought of failure. Doctor Elton was skillful,
the most marvelous surgeon of his kind in the
world. But a little demon of pessimism reminded
her that any operation could fail—no matter how
skillful the physician. But not to Phyl! Not to
Phyl! she repeated over and over. Phyllis certainly
deserved a reward for all her bravery and
courage.</p>

<p class='c008'>The minutes dragged away into hours. The
grayness of the world outside was seeping into the
room. A nurse came in and quietly, efficiently
lighted the lamps, straightened a group of magazines,
and disappeared again.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If somebody doesn’t come to us soon,” Valerie
threatened, “I’m going hunting for Doctor
Elton. Do you suppose he could have forgotten
about us?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale shook her head and turned again to the
window. She did not relish the ride home to the
college in the rain. They had been forced to bring
Phyllis to Weston because it was the nearest
town with a modern, sufficiently equipped hospital
for Doctor Elton. Doctor Norcot was here,
so Phyllis’ father said. The girls had not seen her
as yet, but Gale wished she would bring them
some kind of news now.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We better go out and get our dinner,” Brent
said finally. “We may have to wait quite a while
yet.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I couldn’t eat anything,” David said decisively,
flinging himself into a chair, only to get up
and walk restlessly about again.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nor I,” Gale said.</p>

<p class='c008'>She wondered if Doctor Elton proposed to tell
Phyllis who he was tonight. Hardly, she decided
later; this was scarcely an opportune moment. It
would be a bit of a shock to find after all this time
that Phyllis had a father, and that it should
be Doctor Elton would be more stupendous
still.</p>

<p class='c008'>There were footsteps in the hall. All of them
came to attention. Doctor Elton entered. His face
was grave and pale. He looked more tired than
anyone Gale had ever seen. It was as if all the
cares in the world were on his shoulders. He
seated himself in a chair and looked at them.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well?” David said impatiently.</p>

<p class='c008'>“She will be well again,” the Doctor pronounced.
“Two months should see her back on
her feet as before her accident. She is wonderfully
brave,” he murmured. “I have never seen
such gay courage. I have just left her. She wants
to see you,” he added to the girls. “But only for
a moment,” he added warningly, “she must not
be excited. The nurse will take you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll wait,” Valerie said unselfishly. “Two of
us might be too much.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale followed a white uniformed nurse down
the narrow hall past numerous closed doors. At
last the nurse halted and motioned for Gale to
enter a corner room. Slowly Gale did so. Phyllis
smiled at her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hi!” her friend said faintly. “I came through,
Gale.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Splendidly!” Gale said. “Oh, darling, we’re
so glad for you. Gosh,” she sniffed, “I’ll cry in a
minute. In that case I’ll be put out.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you suppose you can arrange it so I might
see David for a few minutes?” Phyllis whispered.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale’s eyes twinkled. “I’ll try.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Twice a week after that for five weeks Gale
made trips to the hospital to visit Phyllis. Sometimes
Doctor Norcot drove her, sometimes she
took a local bus, but on two occasions the Dean
herself drove Gale.</p>

<p class='c008'>One afternoon when Gale was making her visit
alone Doctor Elton called her into the office before
she saw Phyllis.</p>

<p class='c008'>“So will you tell her, Gale?” the Doctor asked
in conclusion. “I can’t just rush in and say ‘I’m
your father.’ It would be too dramatic and much
too abrupt. Probably she won’t believe it at first.
I can hardly realize myself that I have a grown
daughter.”</p>

<p class='c008'>At his frank smile Gale felt aglow with friendliness.
The more she saw of Doctor Elton the
more she liked him. She could see now where
Phyllis got her capacity for making friends, her
radiating smile and her sense of humor. Doctor
Elton had spent all his time here in Weston, ever
since the discovery of his daughter. But as yet
Phyllis was ignorant of whom he really was.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll tell her,” Gale agreed. “But you had better
be close at hand because I’m sure she will
want to talk to you right away.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll stand outside the door,” he promised. He
straightened his tie nervously. “Do you think she
will like her father?” he asked with a smile.</p>

<p class='c008'>“From what I have seen of you two together,”
Gale said, “she already likes you a lot.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Phyllis was in a chair by the window. The sun
was streaming in. There were magazines and
newspapers in profusion, but Phyllis was busy
with none of these. She had a sketching board
propped up before her and with charcoal was
rapidly transferring the view from the window to
the paper. The low buildings and the farther hillside
upon which spring was already awakening
trees and plants were pictured with exactly the
right delicate shadows and lights.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale opened the door and closed it softly behind
her. Phyllis did not hear her at all, so engrossed
was she in the work at hand. Gale tiptoed
across the room to look over Phyllis’ shoulder.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Splendid!” she commented gayly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phyllis was so startled the pencil dropped from
her hand and rolled on the floor. Gale rescued it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You have been hiding things from me,” Gale
accused. “First a glorious voice and now real artistic
ability. I am discovering that I hardly know
you at all.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Gale!” Phyllis welcomed her eagerly. “Sit
down.” She made room for Gale on the chaise-longue.
“Did you hear? Did the Doctor tell you?
I’m coming back to Briarhurst next week.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You are!” Gale said joyfully. “I’m so glad.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He thinks by the first of May I should be as
good as new—no canes or crutches or anything.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He is a wonderful man,” Gale commented.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Doctor Elton?” Phyllis murmured. “He is—he
is—oh, words fail me,” she laughed. “But I
can never repay him for what he has done—or
you either, for that matter.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Me?” Gale gasped.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You and David and Brent,” Phyllis nodded.
“I just know it was you who were responsible in
bringing Doctor Elton to see me at all.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It wasn’t us alone. It was something much
more important,” Gale said slowly. She thought
this was probably the best opportunity she would
have to tell Phyllis about her father. “I’ve a story
to tell you, Phyl—it is more interesting than a
fairy story—and it is true. Remember that, it is
true!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Reading fairy stories again, Gale?” Phyllis
laughed. “Go ahead, I’m listening.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale took the sketching board and laid it on
the floor, then she grasped both Phyllis’ hands
tightly in her own.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It seems about nineteen years ago a little baby
girl arrived at the home of a certain young doctor
and his wife. The doctor was ambitious and
wealthy. The three were supremely happy. But
one day his wife was killed in a railroad accident.
The doctor was broken-hearted and could really
find peace of mind only in his work. He decided
to go to Europe to study surgery—the height of
his ambition. He entrusted his little girl to the
care of a woman who for years had been his secretary.
He gave her money and told her to look
after the baby until he returned.” Gale paused
for breath. Phyllis was regarding her with steady,
clear eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This woman grew to love the little girl,” Gale
continued, determined to be as charitable as possible
to Miss Fields. “For two years the doctor
remained in Europe making a name for himself—becoming
famous. When he decided to come
home the woman got panicky. She was afraid
something would separate her from the little girl.
She decided to run away and hide and take the
girl with her. She found a small town and a lonely
old house. The doctor returned to the United
States, to his home, to find the woman and the
child gone. No one knows exactly how long he
searched before giving up in despair. Then he returned
to Europe and his work again. Meanwhile,
the woman and the girl remained hidden.
The girl grew up into a sweet young lady and
went away to college.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Gale—what are you saying?” Phyllis whispered
faintly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t you see, dear?” Gale asked gently.
“You’re the little girl—the doctor, your father, is
Doctor Elton.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, no!” Phyllis said. “Gale, it can’t be true—if
you are teasing——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But it is true,” Gale insisted smilingly. “I
know it sounds fantastic but such things can happen.
It has happened. Your Dad is here, Phyl,
and he is never going to let you out of his sight
again. He is waiting outside——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Bring him in,” Phyllis said quickly. “Oh,
please, Gale——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I won’t bring him,” Gale said, “I’ll send him.
I’m off to school again but I’ll be back on Thursday.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale softly closed the door upon Phyllis and
Doctor Elton. Smiling she went out into the sunshine
and boarded the bus. She felt all vivid with
joy herself to think that she had been able to help
a little in giving Phyllis her new happiness—for
there was no doubt that Phyllis was happy. Her
eyes and face had told Gale that much.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale scarcely felt the bruises she acquired while
being bounced around in the bus en route to
Briarhurst. She was in a rosy dream-world where
magical wishes and lovely thoughts came true.
She descended in the little college town and
walked up to the college still in blissful joyland.
She found Carol and Janet and Valerie standing
before the sorority house arguing.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We are not going to tell her now and spoil
everything!” Carol said conclusively.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Tell who what?” Gale wanted to know.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You know we have been saving the news of
our equestrienne ability as a secret for Ricky.
Being western born and bred she thinks she is the
only one here who knows anything about a
horse,” explained Carol.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I want to tell her about our summer in Arizona
when we learned to ride like Indians,” Janet
put in. “She teased me unmercifully this afternoon.
Told me tomorrow in our first riding class
I wouldn’t know one side of the horse from the
other. I won’t stand for it!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But it will only be for a few hours now,” Valerie
soothed her. “Imagine her surprise tomorrow
when we calmly jump into the saddle and
gallop off.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where have you been?” Carol asked Gale.
“To see Phyl? How is she? I’m going with you
on Thursday.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“She is on top of the world,” Gale said happily.
“All taken up with the discovery of her
father.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ricky said——” Janet was continuing with
her original theme when the import of Gale’s
words was borne in upon her. “Phyl is all taken
up with what?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, why don’t you speak distinctly?” Carol
added laughingly. “I almost thought you said
something about Phyl’s father.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I did,” Gale acknowledged calmly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But she hasn’t——” Valerie began. “Wait a
minute! Gale Howard! Have you been doing detective
work on something unbeknownst to us?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is a long story, gals,” Gale said. “Come up
to my room and I will unfold a tale that will
make you throw away your latest detective novel
for lack of interest.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Comfortably ensconced on her bed beside Valerie,
while Carol and Janet hovered at comfortable
if ungraceful angles on Phyllis’ cot, Gale told
them the story she had earlier unfolded to Phyllis.
The girls were as astounded and as sceptical
as Phyllis at first had been. However, they were
all glad things had turned out so happily and
profitably for Phyllis.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Imagine,” Carol said dreamily, “he gets lost
in the jungles of Brazil and comes home to meet
his daughter whom he hasn’t seen for nigh onto
eighteen years.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He hasn’t been lost in the jungle all these
years,” Janet corrected her friend.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No,” Carol admitted, “but isn’t it wonderful?”
she repeated. “Do you suppose,” she continued
hopefully, “he would lend us his yacht to
go cruising this summer?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And get ourselves lost in the jungle as he
did?” put in Janet. “No thanks! I have no desire
to get eaten by a ferocious tiger.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I just mentioned it,” Carol said soothingly.
“Besides, he wasn’t eaten by a tiger.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It was only a matter of time,” Janet said
knowingly. “He probably would have been eventually.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who knows,” Carol said argumentatively,
“perhaps he would have eaten the tiger.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, dry up!” Valerie said explosively. “When
is Phyllis coming back to school, Gale?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Next week,” Gale replied. “She won’t be able
to start classes right away and she will have to
use crutches for two weeks or so, but the doctor
thinks by the first of May she will be as fit as a
fiddle.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Coming back next week?” Carol sat up in
inspiration. “We’ll give her a surprise party.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Fine,” Janet agreed. “But there is one surprise
I am more interested in right now—the one we
are going to give Ricky tomorrow.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A week ago horses had arrived for the students.
The girls had all inspected the ten mounts and
each privately had her own decided upon. Surprisingly
there were not many girls who were interested
in the classes. A lot of them, especially
the upper classmen, already were horsewomen or
had their rosters so full they could not find time
for any more after-hour activities. Not so the
Adventure Girls, however. They were fully determined
to ride as were Gloria and Ricky. The
Adventure Girls had ridden a lot the summer
they spent in Arizona. They could stick in the
saddle of their mount at no matter how fast a
pace on a flat stretch of road. At hurdles is where
they encountered their difficulties and this is what
they wanted to learn. They wanted to learn to
take fences and broad jumps as easily as the riding
instructor. It promised lots of fun as well as
healthful exercise.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch16' class='c009'><i>Chapter XVI</i><br /> <br />THE FIRST LESSON</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“Now don’t be frightened when the horse looks
at you,” Ricky advised Janet patronizingly
as the five Adventure Girls with Ricky and Gloria
walked to the new stables to meet the other two
members of the class and their instructor.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The horse will probably be frightened when
Janet looks at it,” Carol giggled shamelessly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Janet favored them both with a look of utter
disgust and settled her hat at a more rakish angle.</p>

<p class='c008'>At the stables the girls found the two grooms
with saddled mounts ready and waiting. Their
instructor was already mounted. Several upper
classmen had come down to watch the Freshmen
get their first instructions. Among them was
Marcia Marlette and Gale thanked her lucky
stars that she knew something about riding. She
would not look foolish before Marcia. The other
two members of the class arrived and the girls
took the reins of their mounts.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Just watch me,” Ricky whispered to Janet.
“I’ll show you how to mount.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Janet murmured something under her breath
which Ricky innocently did not hear. Ricky
swung into the saddle with the easy familiarity
of being used to horses. Janet followed suit.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Excellent!” Ricky applauded. “It almost
looked as though you had done it before.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m crazy about the merry-go-round,” Janet
explained, coughing away a giggle. “What do we
do now?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Get the correct hold on the reins,” Ricky instructed.</p>

<p class='c008'>With the most guileless of expressions Carol
and Janet, especially, went through the pantomimes
of beginners. The upper classmen spectators
were getting a lot of enjoyment out of the
scene.</p>

<p class='c008'>The horses were spirited mounts but easily
handled by the girls. At last the instructions were
beginning to pall upon Carol and Janet. They
didn’t like the leisurely pace they were forced to
maintain for the class as a unit. When they came
to an open stretch in the road Carol and Janet
urged their horses alongside the instructor. They
talked in low tones for several minutes; finally
she nodded smilingly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yipee!” Janet cheered. “Now, Ricky, we’ll
show you some riding!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Side by side Janet and Carol spurred their
horses on. The mounts, fresh and eager, galloped
away sending up a cloud of dust in their wake.
Ricky watched the two girls in amazement.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where did they learn to ride like that?” she
gasped to Valerie.</p>

<p class='c008'>“On the western plains,” Valerie laughed. “We
spent a summer there. Janet has been bursting to
show you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look at them go!” Gloria cried. “They really
are good.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“On flat roads, yes,” Madge smiled. “Let them
come to a jump—and watch out.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let’s catch them,” Gale proposed.</p>

<p class='c008'>An acquiescent nod from the instructor with a
word of caution, and the Adventure Girls with
Ricky were off in pursuit of their friends.</p>

<p class='c008'>Carol and Janet were racing neck and neck
down the road. They were trying recklessly to
outrun one another. Their horses seemed to enter
into the spirit of the occasion and raced ahead.
The girls bent low in the saddles. They had not
had so much fun since they were in Arizona.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Race you to the old mill,” Janet shouted.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Be there ahead of you,” retorted Carol.</p>

<p class='c008'>Around a bend in the road ahead there was an
old deserted water mill. Its water wheel was still
now and the stream from which it had once secured
current was a mere trickle of water through
the woods. The girls had discovered the old mill
on one of their jaunts about the countryside. Now
Janet and Carol decided it would be a good spot
at which to bring to a close their race.</p>

<p class='c008'>“They must be heading for the old mill,” Valerie
cried to Gale as they followed their friends’
trail of dust.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ricky reined in her horse. “Girls, I, was there
yesterday,” she said excitedly. “There is a big oak
tree down across the road. If they don’t see it and
jump——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come on.” Gale spurred her horse on anew.</p>

<p class='c008'>She and the others could picture what might
happen. Janet and Carol coming around the bend
suddenly, totally unprepared for the tree across
the road, might have a bad fall. If their horses
did not make the jump there would most certainly
be an accident. Even if their horses did
clear the tree that did not say the girls would.
They needed plenty of time to prepare for a jump
and time to think of what to do. Horsemanship
was not as instinctive with them yet as with
Ricky. She could have cleared the jump without
hesitating, but not so the other two Freshmen.</p>

<p class='c008'>Carol, her head down, whispering encouragingly
to her horse, felt that she was having the
most marvelous time of her college term. She had
always loved thoroughbred horses. Inch by inch
her mount pulled ahead of Janet. Gleefully she
observed that at this rate she would win the race.
They were rounding the bend of the road. Not
much farther to go! Carol glanced over her shoulder
at Janet. Her friend was gesticulating wildly
and endeavoring to rein in her horse. Carol mistook
her friend’s gestures for enthusiasm and
waved in return.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look out, Carol!” Janet shouted. “The tree!
Jump!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Janet saw her friend turn. Carol’s horse was
almost upon the huge trunk of an oak tree lying
directly across the road. Carol stiffened, then bent
forward on her horse’s neck. Together, in marvelously
graceful form, Carol’s mount carried both
himself and his rider over the fallen tree successfully.</p>

<p class='c008'>However, Janet, surprised at the appearance
of the tree and in her effort to warn Carol, had
neglected to check her own mount. He raced
ahead. Now it was too late to stop him.</p>

<p class='c008'>The pursuing girls rounded the bend. Their
horses raised a cloud of dust as they were brought
to an abrupt halt by their riders.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Janet!” Madge screamed.</p>

<p class='c008'>The girls saw Janet’s horse try to take the
jump. He rose into the air but with an inexperienced
rider his jump was not successful. His hind
feet caught on the trunk, throwing both him and
his rider heavily to the ground. The horse
scrambled to his feet, leaving his rider prostrate
on the ground.</p>

<p class='c008'>Carol was off her mount in the twinkling of an
eye. The other girls scrambled over or walked
around the fallen tree which had caused the accident.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Are you all right, Jan?” Carol asked anxiously.</p>

<p class='c008'>Janet ruefully inspected herself. “I guess I’m
all here,” she acknowledged.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I should have warned you about that tree,”
Ricky said. “You’re really a good rider,” she
added.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course, ow—oooo—ouch!” With mingled
exclamations Janet managed to get to her feet
with Carol’s help. “And I wanted to show off!”
she giggled. “How did the horse make out?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He is all right,” Valerie said.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We got our signals mixed,” Janet continued
laughingly. “He saw a green light and I a red
one.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How are we going to get the horses back over
the fallen tree?” Carol asked. “I don’t care to
jump mine again.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll jump them for you,” Ricky said promptly.</p>

<p class='c008'>The girls rode back to their instructor and the
other girls. At the stables they dismounted again
and watched while their horses were trotted away
to their stalls.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the sunset they limped toward their dormitories—Janet
by far the most exhausted.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think I’ll take a pillow the next time,” she
declared. “Then if the horse and I decide to
separate I will have something soft to land
on.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The object is not to separate,” Carol informed
her. “Do you want to go riding tomorrow,
Janet?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Riding!” Janet echoed distastefully. “I am
not on speaking terms with my horse. No more
riding for me this week! Tomorrow I shall go in
for something gentle like baseball.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Carol laughed. “Baseball! You can’t come
within five feet of the ball with your bat.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Woe is me,” Janet said, gently depositing herself
upon the dormitory steps. “Do I have to
prove everything? Come to the athletic field tomorrow
and I’ll show you I can hit a home run.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Carol laughed derisively.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I can, too,” Janet insisted. “I hit you, don’t
I, when I throw a book at you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Except when I duck and it goes through the
window,” reminded Carol.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t sit there,” Madge prodded Janet firmly.
“We have to dress for dinner.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And we have to get back to Happiness
House,” added Gale to Ricky and Gloria, but
making no movement toward home.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Isn’t spring the most glorious time of the
year,” sighed Valerie. “When the grass is growing,
the buds budding——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And the brooks brooking,” Carol finished.
“Come along,” she urged Janet. “We have to
dress and I’m hungry.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I will be black and blue tomorrow,” Janet
prophesied gloomily. “My chagrin is mountainous.
To think I had to fall off when we were
going so good.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Console yourself,” Valerie soothed. “We shall
probably all fall off sooner or later.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I will live in hopes,” Janet said brightly.
“What are we going to do tonight?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am going to study my history,” Valerie said
firmly. “Spring exams are just around the corner
and I find my knowledge of dates strangely
lax.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Me for my geometry,” Ricky said sorrowfully.</p>

<p class='c008'>It developed that all the girls had more or less
studying to do for the spring finals. Gradually
they separated, Janet and Carol to drift upstairs
to dress for dinner, Madge and Valerie to follow
more leisurely. Gale walked to the sorority house
with Ricky and Gloria. They separated only to
meet again at dinner. Afterward Gale went off
alone to the solitude of her room to study. She
would be glad to have Phyllis back with her
again.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch17' class='c009'><i>Chapter XVII</i><br /> <br />OMEGA CHI</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>May brought not only the round of festivities
on May Day but the knowledge that
they were in the last stages of the term. Freshmen
were looking forward eagerly now to the time
when they would be Sophomores. Seniors were
looking forward with mingled joy and regret
to the day when they would receive their
diplomas.</p>

<p class='c008'>One evening in May was always devoted to the
sororities and clubs. It was then new members
were chosen and new officers elected for the next
term. The Omega Chi sorority always celebrated
with a big party for their members. During the
evening the newly elected members were sought
out and informed of their good fortune in being
selected to fill the vacancies left by Seniors going
out.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Omega Chi was eagerly sought by all the
Freshmen. It meant not only belonging to the
most popular group on the campus, but the girls
were, for the most part, honor students, students
likely to succeed in campus activities as well as
their chosen profession later. There was no discrimination
for the wealthy girls. The officers
sought girls who were honorable, pleasant, and
had a sense of humor. The standards they secretly
set were sometimes hard to surpass and it was
the reason the sorority had not a larger membership
than it had.</p>

<p class='c008'>On this night the officers of the Omega Chi
were secreted in the dining room. Freshmen had
been banished to their rooms. Other sorority
members lounged about the living room or on the
veranda outside. The tinkle of a guitar and the
hum of girlish voices rose to Gale and Phyllis at
the window of their room.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phyllis had returned to the campus two weeks
ago. As yet she had not been out of her room.
That was something Gale could not understand.
Doctor Elton had been so sure, so positive, that
the first of May would see Phyllis as well as ever.
Yet here she was still tied to her armchair at the
window.</p>

<p class='c008'>“A glorious night, Phyl,” Gale said dreamily.
“Did you ever see so many stars—or see them so
close?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Listen to the girls singing,” Phyllis said.</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘The girls of Omega Chi!’” The last words
of the sorority song floated up to them.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you suppose we would be fortunate
enough to be elected to the sorority?” Gale asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phyllis laughed. “If we aren’t we will probably
have to move next term.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Perhaps I had better start packing,” Gale
laughed. “But seriously—I want terribly to get
into Omega Chi. I like all the girls so much——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“All the girls?” Phyllis asked lazily. “Even
Marcia Marlette?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t spoil my evening!” Gale said quickly.
“I refuse to think of her.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You have to think of her,” Phyllis laughed.
“She might be president next term when Adele is
no longer here.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I hope not!” Gale said aghast. “The girls
would never elect her—surely!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Funny things can happen,” Phyllis reminded
her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Phyllis——” Gale rested her chin on her hand
and gazed at the moon. “Is your father coming
to see you tomorrow?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, why?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ve got something to ask him,” Gale said.
“Do you suppose Janet and Carol will get into
the sorority?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What do you want to ask my Dad?” Phyllis
interposed. “Is it—about me?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” Gale said firmly, decisively. “He told
me you would be hopping about like a sparrow
by the first of May. You aren’t and I want to
know why,” she said bluntly, watching Phyllis
closely.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know,” Phyllis said, bowing her head. “He
told me too. He has done everything he can. It is
my own fault that I’m not.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m afraid to try it,” Phyllis said. “I’m afraid
everything won’t be as perfect as he says it will.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But, Phyl, there is nothing to be afraid of——”
Gale said gently. “It is all up to you now.
You are only holding yourself back.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know,” Phyllis said faintly. “But the day
I came back to the campus—I tried to walk. The
doctors and nurse made me get up and walk
across the room—at least try to. I didn’t make it.
I fell and now—I’m afraid to try again.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But that was natural for the first time,” Gale
soothed. “Darling, you’ve got to try it again.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll try it when I get enough courage,” Phyllis
sighed. “But I’m running rather low on courage
right now.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But——” Gale began.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hist!” Ricky hissed from the door. “I have
secret information that the new candidates have
been selected,” she informed them.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who are they?” Gale asked eagerly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well,” Ricky acknowledged, seating herself
beside Gale, “that is still a mystery.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“They bring the girls from the other dormitory
houses here, don’t they, for the celebration?”
Phyllis asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” Gale answered. “Look!” She pointed
out the window. “There go two of the girls now—I’ll
wager they are going after some Freshmen.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The campus gradually became alive with girls,
figures moving back and forth, each intent upon
some errand. Suddenly two figures stepped out of
the night below the girls’ window. A few seconds
later two more joined the first.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hi!”</p>

<p class='c008'>They recognized Carol’s gay voice and knew it
was the remaining four Adventure Girls.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes?” Gale called.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We made it!” Carol shouted. “We’re in!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And we are coming right up to see you,”
added Janet.</p>

<p class='c008'>At the same moment a knock sounded on their
door. An upper classman informed them that
they, too, had been elected full-fledged members
in the Omega Chi, and since one of their number
was not able to come downstairs to partake in the
reception for the Freshmen, they would bring the
reception to their room. Gale’s and Phyllis’ room
became the reception place for twenty new members.
Adele, in her position of president, calmly
took possession of Gale’s desk over which to
transact the business of her office.</p>

<p class='c008'>The little group listened attentively to the purposes
of the sorority as extolled by their president,
and paid strict attention while the constitution
and list of new officers were read to them.
They were humorously reminded, before they
broke up, that their initiation would take place
at the beginning of the new term.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c008'>The next afternoon after classes Gale made her
way to the lake. Doctor Elton had promised to
have Phyllis there in the sunshine. Gale had made
a flying visit to her room to don a bathing suit
for a swim, and finding Phyllis absent, concluded
that the Doctor had kept his word.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale had been thinking over what Phyllis told
her last night. What a struggle had been going
on in Phyllis’ mind these past weeks and none of
them had guessed! Just those few words on the
night before had brought home to Gale the
knowledge of what Phyllis was up against. The
girl was afraid—terribly afraid that the miracle
Doctor Elton had performed would not hold.
Something must be done! The girls must do something
to bring back Phyl’s self-confidence. But
what? Only Phyllis herself could really go
through this trial. She must try her own strength.
That was the only way she could ever possibly be
sure of herself again.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phyllis and her father were sitting on a bench
overlooking the lake. Gale waved as they saw her
approaching. Phyllis’ hand was in the crook of
her father’s arm and she looked very happy. Gale
told herself that the discovery of Phyl’s father
had worked miracles—all but the most important
one.</p>

<p class='c008'>Doctor Elton strolled away from Phyllis and
approached Gale. Just out of earshot of the girl
on the bench they stopped. They talked together
for several minutes and then Gale came on to
Phyllis while Doctor Elton went toward the
campus.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Glorious afternoon,” Gale said dropping beside
Phyllis.</p>

<p class='c008'>“So nice and warm in the sunshine,” Phyllis
agreed. “Where did my Dad go?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Said he had a date with Doctor Norcot, but
he will be right back. Have you seen Janet or
Carol today?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No. Valerie told me they were riding again.
Ricky flew away to join them when she heard
of it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Been here long?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No. I waited for my Dad to bring me down,”
Phyllis said.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale looked at Phyllis, at the crutches lying on
the grass at the side of the bench, and then away
across the blue waters of the lake. Her eyes were
narrowed in silent thought. She saw the thick
growth of trees on the farther shore, the calm
waters along the grassy bank almost at her feet,
and the treacherous current farther out in the
center of the lake, but it was not of these things
she was thinking.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Have you tried to walk today?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Phyllis sighed. “I’ll try it some time—but now
I’m too peaceful here.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Doesn’t your father want you to try?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That is all I hear,” Phyllis said wearily. “He
insists—and he is a great insister,” she added
smilingly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But you are just as determined to wait,”
Gale laughed. “Well, when you decide let me
know.” She stretched lazily. “I think I’ll go for a
swim.”</p>

<p class='c008'>From the pocket of her jacket she drew a red
bathing cap and slipped it over her curls. She divested
herself of her jacket and waved to Phyllis
as she darted away.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t go out too far and get caught in the current,”
Phyllis warned.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll be all right,” Gale called back.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phyllis watched the blue waters close over her
friend. With a little sigh she leaned back. She
wished heartily she could be in there with Gale.
However, she couldn’t, so why worry about it?</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale was having a glorious time. The water
was cold but she did not mind it. Her strokes cut
the water cleanly and swiftly. The water along
the shore was calm and little ripples drifted up
to the bank. Slowly and carefully Gale worked
her way out a little farther, always mindful of
the whirl of waters which swept continually to
the falls at the farther end of the lake. Gale used
to swim often in the waters of the bay near her
home. She was an excellent swimmer and diver,
one of the champions on the team at High School
but she had not entered into the competition here
at Briarhurst.</p>

<p class='c008'>The sun was sinking farther into the west all
the time and Phyllis was becoming impatient to
get back to the sorority house, but she did want
to wait for her father. Gale said he promised to
return immediately, but so far he had not come.
Gale was in the water a long time and Phyllis was
thinking of calling her to suggest going back to
Happiness House when she noted signs of distress
from Gale. All was not well with her friend.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Help, Phyl!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Faintly Gale’s voice came over the blue waters
of the lake that separated them. Phyllis gripped
the bench hard. Gale was struggling in the water
to keep her head on the surface. Anxiously Phyllis
looked about. The two girls were alone at this
point. Phyllis called aloud but her voice echoed
hollowly back to her. The frantic splashes in the
water were becoming fainter as Gale grew weaker.
Once again Phyllis shouted, but there was no answering
call.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale was a good swimmer, she would pull
through, Phyllis assured herself. But she was also
reminded that even good swimmers had been
known to drown—and Gale was being swept
nearer and nearer to the swirling current. Phyllis
uttered a swift silent prayer that help would
miraculously come from somewhere—but it
didn’t.</p>

<p class='c008'>The woods remained silent except for the little
rustle of leaves and the twitter of birds. The
water lapped the shore just as gently and undisturbedly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Horror stricken, Phyllis saw Gale’s red cap
disappear beneath the surface. Anxiety, an urge
stronger than herself to help Gale, gripped Phyllis.
She forgot about the crutches lying on the
grass, forgot that she was afraid to walk. Her eyes
were on the water—seeking sight of the red cap.
It bobbed to the surface and she rose to her feet.
The cap disappeared beneath the blue waters
again and Phyllis took several hasty steps toward
the shore.</p>

<p class='c008'>Miraculously her father appeared from a clump
of shrubbery while from a little farther back in
the growth of trees came Doctor Norcot.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh—hurry—Gale——” Phyllis began desperately.</p>

<p class='c008'>Doctor Elton let out a shrill whistle. Gale’s red
cap appeared on the surface and with clean-cut
strokes the girl swam for the shore. She climbed
dripping wet up the bank.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Gale——” Phyllis began.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sorry to frighten you so, Phyl,” Gale said lovingly,
“but I didn’t drown after all. Our plan
worked, Doctor Elton,” she added triumphantly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Your plan?” Phyllis murmured when for the
first time she became aware that she was standing
unassisted—she had actually walked alone
for several paces!</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale put a wet arm about Phyllis. “Darling,
you did it!” she exclaimed. “You forgot yourself
and walked.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then you weren’t really in danger!” Phyllis
echoed. “But I was so frightened I couldn’t think
of anything but——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Helping me,” Gale finished. “That was exactly
what we counted on.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Phyllis took a deep breath. “Now I’m going to
walk back to the sorority house,” she said determinedly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phyllis slipped her arm within her father’s.
With his help she led the way back to the campus.
Doctor Norcot and Gale followed more slowly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you think she is doing too much at once?”
Gale whispered.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Doctor Elton knows best,” the college physician
replied.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phyllis was in the most excellent of spirits
when they reached Happiness House. She was
tired but she would not admit it and insisted upon
going down to the dining room for dinner to sit
in her old place beside Gale. The girls greeted her
with hilarity and a warm welcome. Even Marcia
Marlette expressed her pleasure at seeing Phyllis
back. But after dinner Phyllis went upstairs with
Gale and immediately to bed. She was worn out
not only with the unaccustomed physical activity
but the mental strain.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale sat at the desk and wrote a long letter to
Brent. Afterward she knelt at the window and let
the May breeze ruffle her hair while she watched
the lights in the other dormitories slowly being
extinguished.</p>

<p class='c008'>From the room upstairs came smothered giggles
and a thump. Marcia Marlette and her roommate
were having a party. Gale frowned at the
night. Marcia, much to Gale’s and the other girls’
amazement, had been elected to the office of president
of the sorority for the next term. How the
feat had been accomplished Gale did not know,
but she was not enthusiastic about it. Marcia
could never be the friendly president that Adele
Stevens had been this term. Gale rebuked herself.
She mustn’t believe the worst until it happened.
Marcia had been exceedingly nice to Phyllis this
afternoon. Perhaps the responsibilities of her new
office would bring out the better side of Marcia’s
nature. But Gale doubted it. The next term did
not look very bright for the sorority with Marcia
at the helm of the organization.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale yawned and crawled into bed. The next
term would have to take care of itself. Right now
there was the question of whether Marcia and her
friends would break through the ceiling.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch18' class='c009'><i>Chapter XVIII</i><br /> <br />CAROL SLIDES</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The balmy May afternoon saw the baseball
game between the Freshmen and the Sophomores
taking place on the athletic field behind
Carver Hall. The players were most enthusiastic
about this latest undertaking of theirs. It seemed
most of the girls in the school had turned out to
see this tussle between two feminine baseball
teams and to hail the victor.</p>

<p class='c008'>Janet, with supreme confidence in her own ability,
had elected herself pitcher for the Freshmen.
The girls had played several games and Janet had
been pretty good, if not particularly brilliant.
Carol, to support her pal, was catcher. Valerie
was acting first baseman and Madge was shortstop.
Their gymnastics teacher was the umpire
and the Freshmen were sometimes suspicious of
her friendly feeling toward the Sophomores.
However, the nine Freshmen elected “Do or Die!”
as their motto and went into the game with all
the vigor and speed at their command.</p>

<p class='c008'>But alas, the Sophomores were also good. They
had experience added to their playing ability and
for the first three innings scored four runs to the
Freshmen’s one. Janet, finding herself up against
excellent batting ability, became nervous. Her
throws to the home plate were a little wild and
two girls walked to base.</p>

<p class='c008'>Carol met Janet halfway between the pitcher’s
mound and the home plate where the next Sophomore
stood swinging her bat.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Are you good!” Carol scoffed. “I thought you
were the world’s wonder woman pitcher. I’m beginning
to believe you are the world’s worst.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s gratitude for you!” Janet sighed. “Here
I nearly throw my arm out of joint and I get no
credit from you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I told you to throw them a little low for Agnes
and you didn’t. You deliberately threw the ball
at her bat. All she had to do was stand still and
let it hit. It cost us another run.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“So what?” Janet said wearily.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come on, toots, do your stuff,” Carol encouraged.
“We’ve got to strike this girl out.”</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Brackity saxe, saxe, saxe,</div>
      <div class='line'>Brackity saxe, saxe, saxe,</div>
      <div class='line'>Y-e-a, Freshmen!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The spectators chanted loudly and enthusiastically.
Gale and Phyllis led the Freshmen rooting
section in an uproarious cheer. They yelled with
all the abandon of children on a spree.</p>

<p class='c008'>Janet beamed upon the crowd and swung the
ball.</p>

<p class='c008'>“St-uh-rike one!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Carol ran out and handed the ball to Janet.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Swell, pal!” she declared.</p>

<p class='c008'>Janet beamed again and threw the ball.</p>

<p class='c008'>“St-uh-rike two!” The Instructor was having
as much fun out of the game as the girls were.</p>

<p class='c008'>Janet, concentrating on the batter before her,
had momentarily forgotten the girls on first and
second base. The Sophomore on second base was
an adventurous soul and now she took advantage
of the pitcher’s absorption to steal to third. Halfway
there Janet saw her and threw the ball wildly
to Madge, the short stop. The Sophomore dived
for the base. The baseman received the ball from
Madge while the Sophomore turned and dashed
madly back toward second. The ball went again
to Madge. The Sophomore tried once more for
third base. The runner see-sawed back and forth
until she was finally caught and pronounced out.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Freshmen were jubilant, especially Janet
and Carol. The pitcher returned to the work at
hand and the batter-up was struck out.</p>

<p class='c008'>The innings went on until the ninth. At that
time the score stood twelve to ten in favor of the
Sophomores. Janet had been relieved in the pitcher’s
position by another Freshman. However, in
the last inning she returned.</p>

<p class='c008'>Somehow the Freshmen managed to keep the
score the same. They did not let the Sophomores
score again and the side retired. The Freshmen
were at bat.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t like the wicked look in that pitcher’s
eye,” Janet said as she stood beside Carol watching
Valerie at bat.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You probably won’t hit the ball either,” Carol
pronounced sadly as Valerie struck out.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is that so?” Janet bristled with indignation.
“Maybe I haven’t made a home run this game
yet but I’ve been waiting for a crucial moment.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It looks like this is it,” Carol laughed. “There
goes another one of our girls—out!” She sighed.
“Ho, hum, we might as well give in. We need two
runs, but we’ll never make them with only one
more girl—and you are it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Janet frowned on her. “I’ll hit that ball if it is
the last thing I do!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Carol’s eyes twinkled as she watched Janet
take her place before the catcher.</p>

<p class='c008'>“She is angry,” Madge commented.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I tried to make her mad,” Carol confessed.
“When she is stirred up she plays much better.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“St-uh-rike one!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Carol made a wry face at Janet. The latter
frowned more viciously and gripped the bat securely
in both hands. Carol nudged Madge significantly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“She is really cross now.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The spectators were hushed. The game depended
on Janet and what she did.</p>

<p class='c008'>“St-uh-rike two!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Woe is me!” Carol murmured. “My psychology
didn’t work.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“She has one more chance,” Madge said. “If she
only gets on base and then someone else makes a
run——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Two runs to tie the score! It might as well be
ten,” Carol said pessimistically.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look! Look!” Madge cried gleefully. “She
did it! She socked that old ball way out——”</p>

<p class='c008'>Janet had swung with all her strength and hit
the ball squarely, sending it high into the air over
second base. The Sophomore in her effort to get
it overshot the mark and fumbled. Janet was
away like a shot to first base, past first and safe
on second!</p>

<p class='c008'>“I hope I do as well,” Carol remarked.</p>

<p class='c008'>She was the next batter up. The Freshmen were
still howling with delight over Janet’s hit. The
first was a foul ball. The second attempt Carol
missed. But the third time! Like Janet, the necessity
for action brought cool determination
and steadied her. She hit the ball a resounding
smack that sent it bounding along the third base
line.</p>

<p class='c008'>Janet was off to third base while Carol sped to
first. Both girls were safe.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now the game looked particularly bright for
the Freshmen. With two girls on bases they had
a good chance to even the score. But if one more
was pronounced out the game was over and lost.
Another Freshman stepped up to the home plate.
She was nervous but determined.</p>

<p class='c008'>Janet took several steps away from third base
but kept a wary eye on the pitcher. She simply
must get in and score! She looked at Carol.</p>

<p class='c008'>Carol was edging away from the security of
first base. The pitcher was looking at Carol. Janet
went a little farther toward home. Carol suddenly
dived toward second. The pitcher threw
the ball to the second base. The baseman missed
it and it bounded a few feet away. By the time
the ball was secured Carol was safe on second
base and Janet had stolen home.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Freshmen fans were wild. They cheered
lustily. Their team needed only one run to tie the
score now!</p>

<p class='c008'>The Sophomore pitcher seemed to have lost her
grip on the situation. The Freshman at bat
walked to first base. The next girl also walked.
That forced Carol to third base. What a chance
now to tie the score—even to win the game!</p>

<p class='c008'>Carol watched the pitcher closely. She edged
away from the base. The baseman followed. It all
happened very suddenly. Carol in her exuberance
and confidence in having stolen to second base
once, thought she could do the same thing again.
The pitcher was watching the strange motions of
the girl at first base when Carol dived for the
home plate. With lightning rapidity the pitcher
whirled and tossed the ball. In a cloud of dust
and cinders Carol slid into the catcher.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Out!” the umpire said firmly, indisputably.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Sophomores were jubilant, their team had
won! The Freshmen were downcast, but they did
their best to hide it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of all the dizzy tricks——” Carol derided herself.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You did great,” Janet defended surprisingly.
“We gave them a thrill anyway.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But I had to spoil our big chance,” Carol
wailed. “If I had only waited——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s the difference?” Valerie said gayly.
“They only beat us by one point.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And I hit the ball,” Janet reminded her friend.
“What did you say about my not being able to
even see it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I take it all back,” Carol said humbly. Then
she bristled with indignation. “I think I was safe
at home, and I also think the umpire was on the
Sophomores’ side!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Tush!” Janet said. “Let’s change and join
Gale and Phyl.”</p>

<p class='c008'>For all of the other girls’ levity Carol was inconsolable.
She felt responsible for the girls losing
the game and even though they in no way
chided her or scolded she blamed herself.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It was the best ball game I ever saw,” Phyllis
declared when they were all united on the East
Campus Dormitory steps. “I never thought girls
could play such good baseball.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You have no idea what we can do,” Janet told
her condescendingly. “You should see us pull
taffy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Whoops! How exciting,” Madge laughed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Exciting or not, it is a good idea,” Janet said.
She beamed upon Gale and Phyllis. “If you two
sorority sisters could find a way to come up and
see us tonight we might have a taffy pull.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ll be there,” Phyllis promised promptly.
“Nothing could induce me to miss it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“See you tonight then,” Carol yawned. “I’m
going to get some last minute studying in on my
Geometry. Tomorrow is our final exam.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The other four girls disappeared within the
dormitory house while Gale and Phyllis strolled
toward Happiness House in the afternoon sunset.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let’s go see White Star,” Phyllis proposed.
“We have plenty of time before dinner.”</p>

<p class='c008'>White Star was the mount in the stables which
Phyllis had chosen for her own when she first
started to ride two days before. She had long before
visited the stables with the other girls and
made friends with the black horse who had the
white star on his forehead from which he got his
name. She had ridden, too, that summer in Arizona
but just two days ago had she begun her
proper training at Briarhurst. Every day found
her participating more and more in the activities
which she had at first pursued when she came to
college. Gale, too, did not need to act for Phyllis
any more as president pro tem of the Freshman
class. Phyllis was now able to attend to all
the business in which she was involved.</p>

<p class='c008'>There were no riding classes this afternoon
and all the horses were in their stalls with only
one groom on guard. White Star whinnied softly
at the girls’ approach. He was a magnificent animal—sturdy,
and his satiny coat was smooth and
shiny. He nuzzled Phyllis’ shoulder with his soft
nose.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Get away, old softie,” she said smiling.
“Want some sugar?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Eagerly the horse thrust his nose into her hand
and secured the white lump.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you carry a supply of sugar with you?”
Gale laughed. “Every time you come here you
have some and White Star knows it. He would
follow you back to the sorority house if he could
get out.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Phyllis rubbed White Star’s forehead.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He is a great horse,” she said, “the only one
I’ll ride here at school.” She brought forth another
piece of sugar from her pocket. “That is the
last!” she warned.</p>

<p class='c008'>With a final pat for White Star the girls left
the stall. The horse sent a soft whinny after
them.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The Dean is a lot more popular with the girls
now than she was before, isn’t she?” Phyllis murmured.
“The new organ in the chapel, these
riding lessons—everything has won the girls
over.”</p>

<p class='c008'>It was true. The resentment against the Dean
had miraculously faded with the realization that
everything she planned was really for the benefit
of the school and the girls there. All trouble had
ceased with the departure of Miss Horton. Now
Briarhurst was the most peaceful and harmonious
spot in the world. But sometimes even the
most blissful peace is rudely disturbed.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch19' class='c009'><i>Chapter XIX</i><br /> <br />WHITE STAR</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The taffy pull was most successful. With due
secrecy Gale and Phyllis had managed to get
out of Happiness House and into their friends’
dormitory without being discovered. What really
might happen if they were found would be serious
but they were skylarking and they did not
think of the consequences of their act. They were
too intent on having a good time.</p>

<p class='c008'>The high spot of the evening came when
Carol’s hands were both occupied with pulling
the golden strands of sticky mass.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ooooo,” she cried, “my ear itches. What’ll I
do?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Scratch it,” Janet suggested practically.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And get my golden curls all full of molasses?”
Carol demanded. “Think of something else. Only
hurry up—ooooooo!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Valerie came to the rescue. She was the only
one who had available a hand which was not entangled
in the taffy.</p>

<p class='c008'>After that they ate and pulled to their hearts’
content. The evening flew away. When the lights-out
bell rang Gale and Phyllis decided it was
high time for them to be getting back to Happiness
House. It would be quite a puzzle for them
to get safely back to their room unseen. They
hoped the door was not yet locked.</p>

<p class='c008'>With the stealth of criminals they left the dormitory
house. Once on the campus they paused
in the shade of the trees to breathe freely. From a
window Janet and Carol waved to their two
friends and silently disappeared within the darkness
of their room. The girls on the campus
strolled leisurely toward the darkened Happiness
House. They were really in no hurry and it was
such a nice evening.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some imp of mischief whispered in their ear
and they turned toward the lake. They stood on
the shore and watched the moonlight make little
gold ripples on the waves. They explored the
dark shadows of the thick growth of trees along
the lake and shivered at the eerie noises.</p>

<p class='c008'>Finally Gale became sleepy and they decided
that they really must go back to their room. Tomorrow
they had a difficult examination to pass,
for which they had studied for days and days. It
was important that they should be fresh in the
morning.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We really shouldn’t have gone to that party
tonight,” Phyllis yawned. “I haven’t a blessed
Geometry thought in my head.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We had fun though,” Gale said. “I never ate
so much taffy in my life.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What would happen if we were caught in another
dormitory house?” Phyllis wanted to know.
“We wouldn’t be expelled, would we?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale made a wry face. “Why must you think
of those things?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Phyllis put a hand on Gale’s arm. In the darkness
of the trees they stood listening. They could
hear the gentle lapping of the lake water almost
at their feet. From over their head an eerie voice
demanded:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who-o-o-o.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A pair of eyes glared down at them like green
electric light bulbs suddenly flashed on and
turned off then flashed on again as an owl blinked
through the night.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Doesn’t he scare you?” Phyllis shivered. “He
reminds me of a Hallowe’en goblin.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We really should go to bed,” Gale said once
more, “as much as I hate to admit it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ve had a lot of fun this term, haven’t we?”
Phyllis sighed. “It is hard to believe that our
Freshman year is almost over.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Fun!” Gale echoed. “I wouldn’t say you had
so much fun,” she added.</p>

<p class='c008'>“On the whole I did,” Phyllis declared, “and I
even found a father! He is going to Marchton to
see Miss Fields and move all my belongings,” she
continued.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He is! What is going to happen to Miss
Fields?” Gale asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I asked him not to do anything about her,”
Phyllis said. “All I want is never to have to go
back there.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then we won’t see you much this summer,”
Gale sighed. “Marchton will seem different.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I’ll see you all right,” Phyllis said but she
did not explain further then.</p>

<p class='c008'>The girls had left the wood shore line behind
them and come out again upon the campus. Now
they could see the stars above them twinklingly
close.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look at that red glow back of the Chemistry
Hall,” Gale said suddenly. “What do you suppose
it is?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I can’t imagine,” Phyllis said. “Something at
the stables. Let’s investigate.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Keeping in the shadows so as to be out of sight
of any wandering teacher the girls crept around
the Chemistry Hall. What they saw froze them
momentarily to the spot with horror. Flames
were curling around the corner of the main stable
and smoke was pouring from a shattered window.
From the groom’s quarters stumbled one of the
attendants. The other regular man was not on
the grounds today.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Gale,” Phyllis said urgently, “there is a fire
alarm attached to Carver Hall. Sound it! Tell the
Dean——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Right!” Gale said promptly, not waiting to
hear any more, and sped away.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phyllis ran forward. “Are you all right?” she
demanded of the man.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The smoke——” he choked.</p>

<p class='c008'>A frightened whinny from the stables brought
Phyllis up short. The poor trapped horses! She
couldn’t stand there and do nothing!</p>

<p class='c008'>“Get the fire apparatus working!” she shouted
and dashed for the stables. Madly she dashed
back again. “Got a knife?” she asked the groom.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dazed from the smoke and the sudden confusion,
where an hour ago had been peace, the man
nodded his head and struggled to get a pen knife
from his pocket. Once it was secured Phyllis
dashed again to the nearest stall. The horses were
trampling, rearing, whinnying in fright. The
smoke was thick and it was impossible to breathe
freely.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phyllis was hurled against the side of the stall
as the horse rose on his hind legs pawing the air
wildly with his forehoofs, straining at the rope
which tied his bridle to the stall. She picked herself
up from the straw mumbling unintelligible
things when she discovered she had dropped the
knife. Her fingers found the rope but it was impossible
under such conditions to untie the knot.
Quite by accident, a lucky accident, her foot
came in contact with the knife as she dodged another
flying hoof. She picked it up and cut the
rope. Pulling and coaxing she got the horse into
the open air. She tied him securely to the hitching
post where the girls were wont to dismount
after their classes. It was a sufficient distance
away from the burning stables to make him safe.
It was absolutely necessary to tie him, although
it wasted several precious minutes. Otherwise,
with the queer trait of his breed, he would immediately
have dashed back into the building.</p>

<p class='c008'>Once more Phyllis returned to the stable. The
groom had disappeared, probably in search of
help and fire extinguishers. The uproar of the
horses beat in her ears. Their frightened whinnies
were even more pitiful than human cries might
have been. The animals were so helpless! The
second horse was led and tied to the post beside
the first. She felt bruised where another flying
forefoot had caught her off guard. The flames
were roaring like a furnace now. The straw in
the stables would be excellent food for the flames.
Luckily the fire had started in the groom’s
quarter and must work up through the harness
room. If it had started in the heart of the stables
themselves she would never have been able to get
near the horses.</p>

<p class='c008'>One by one Phyllis brought the horses out.
When the last one was secure she leaned weakly
against the post. The alarm bell was tolling now.
It had been ringing for several minutes but in her
absorption she had not heard it. Soon the girls
would be on the scene and the fire apparatus
would be in play. Phyllis felt as if she would
never again get the smell of smoke out of her system.</p>

<p class='c008'>One—two—three—she counted the horses
neighing and rearing at their posts. Nine! There
should be ten! With a sinking of heart she looked
at them all again. White Star was not there!
White Star! The best of the group! How could
she possibly have missed him?</p>

<p class='c008'>Without another thought but that of her favorite
mount Phyllis dashed back into the
stables. One—two—three—stalls empty. Nothing
but silence and the crackling of flames—flames
creeping closer, destroying, and smoke.</p>

<p class='c008'>Her head was whirling and she felt choked.
Once she stumbled wildly over something and
fell to her knees in the straw. She sat there several
seconds, dazed. She had better find White
Star soon or they would both be trapped! Why
didn’t help come? Though only a few minutes
could have elapsed since she and Gale first
sighted the fire it seemed like hours. What was
that?</p>

<p class='c008'>An excited whinny came to her, followed by
the sound of crashing blows against wood. White
Star! And he was trying to kick his stall to
pieces! Despite the terribly desperate situation
Phyllis could not help but smile. White Star proposed
to fight! She stumbled to her feet and went
on prowling through the smoke until she came to
the stall in which all the uproar was taking place.
She felt as though all the strength in her body
was leaving her. White Star was bucking and
kicking with all his might. The smoke was like
a blanket smothering everything and through
which Phyllis felt her way to White Star’s head.
She took hold of his bridle and he nuzzled against
her shoulder affectionately. He seemed to recognize
his friend. With her last remaining strength
Phyllis cut the rope that held White Star. She
turned him around and gave him a stinging
blow.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Go it, boy!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The horse reared and plunged out through the
door of his stall, leaving Phyllis a huddled figure
on the straw.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c008'>Gale, after turning the electric switch that
automatically sounded the fire alarm, had sped
to the Dean’s office. She found Dean Travis
working late. After excitedly blurting out the
news Gale dashed again to the stables, stopping
for nothing. She was just in time to see White
Star appear.</p>

<p class='c008'>The horse bounded out of the smoke into the
cool night air. He stopped short, raised his head
and whinnied, pawing the ground with his forehoof.
He glanced at the other horses, straining at
their ropes, tossed his head, and turning, dashed
back for the burning stable.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Phyl——” Gale shouted.</p>

<p class='c008'>There was no reply. Gale saw the groom and
another man playing a stream of water upon the
flames on one side of the building. She went
closer. Through the smoke she could see White
Star.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale could not explain White Star’s actions.
She had read of how horses always dashed back
into the burning building from which they were
rescued, unless they were tied outside. It was evident
that Phyllis had tied the others, why not
White Star? This was her favorite!</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale looked at the other struggling horses and
wondered at the strength of her friend. Horses
were strong at any time—frightened, terrorized
as they were now, she did not see how Phyllis had
managed to get them all out.</p>

<p class='c008'>White Star appeared out of the smoke and almost
ran her down. He stood for a second looking
at her, pawing the ground and tossing his
head.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale remembered seeing a wonder horse in the
movies who acted like this when he was summoning
help for his master. Was it possible—— White
Star was a magnificent animal. She had always
acknowledged that, but she had never actually
credited him with super intelligence. However,
now his eyes seemed to be pleading with
her; the crazy way he dashed about made her
think he was trying to tell her something.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Phyllis!” Gale shouted again.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ahoy.” Carol and Janet dashed up breathlessly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We got here first because we didn’t have to
stop to dress seeing that we weren’t yet undressed—if
you understand me,” Janet said.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We might have known you would be here,”
added Carol. “Where’s Phyl?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look at that horse!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The groom had taken it into his head to rescue
White Star and tie him beside the other horses.
But White Star had other ideas. He raced madly
past the flames and into the smoke.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think I know what he wants!” Gale cried
and the next time White Star dashed into sight
she followed him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The crazy——” Carol began. “Gale, come
back!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Gale bumped into White Star. She was unable
to see him clearly, the smoke hurt her eyes, and
she was choking for breath. With one hand on his
bridle she let him pull her along. The horse
trotted forward until he came to his stall. There
he stopped.</p>

<p class='c008'>“W-What now?” Gale coughed. Dimly through
the smoke she became aware of a figure lying on
the ground. “Phyl!” she screamed. “Phyl!”</p>

<p class='c008'>A burning rafter crashed to the ground at some
little distance. White Star reared and plunged
away but a second later he was back, trembling
and whinnying. Gale lifted Phyllis and put her
across White Star’s back. Necessity and fear had
lent her strength and now she pulled White Star’s
head down to her shoulder. With a tight grip on
his bridle she started forward at a run. The horse
plunged after her. How she managed to dash out
through the smoke Gale didn’t quite know but
thankfully she had come at last to her friend.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch20' class='c009'><i>Chapter XX</i><br /> <br />THE END OF THE TERM</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“I am personally going to buy White Star a
whole box of sugar for his very own,” Carol
said positively. “The horse is a hero.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And he speaks a language all his own,” added
Janet. “Gale understood him but we didn’t.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is lucky for me that Gale did understand
him,” Phyllis said lazily.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was the last day of classes, weeks after the
fire at the stables. The girls were gathered on the
campus after their last classroom session, discussing
the high points of their college term. The
miraculous way White Star had summoned help
for Phyllis never ceased to be a thing of wonder
to them. Neither Phyllis nor Gale had suffered
other than a slight sickness from smoke. New
stables had been erected and riding classes had
gone on as before, with the exception of White
Star’s sensational rise in popularity.</p>

<p class='c008'>“All the girls want to ride him,” Madge
laughed, “but he seems to prefer Phyllis.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ah, yes, brothers under the skin,” Carol giggled
daringly. “What is this power you have over
horses, Phyl?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The same you have over Chemistry professors,”
Phyllis retorted. “What I want to know is,
why did Professor Lukens pass you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Because I’m brilliant,” Carol said modestly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“More likely because he wanted to be rid of
you,” Janet put in. “You asked more questions in
class than——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let’s go down to the village and get a soda at
the drug store,” Madge proposed peacefully.</p>

<p class='c008'>“An excellent suggestion,” Carol said immediately.
“Why don’t you think of things like
that?” she asked Janet.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Because walking doesn’t appeal to me,” Janet
said promptly. “Now if—behold!” she said in
astonishment.</p>

<p class='c008'>The girls were at the edge of the college
grounds. Mounting the hill to the gate was a new,
shiny bus which declared in broad white letters
on the side “Briarhurst College.” At the wheel
was the same old fellow who had met them in his
dilapidated contraption when they arrived at
Briarhurst and who had been so against the new
Dean because she wanted to buy him a new bus.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Say, did somebody leave you money?” Janet
shouted.</p>

<p class='c008'>He stopped the bus and opened the door.
“Want a ride to the village? Ain’t she a beauty?”
he asked next when the girls had accepted his invitation
with alacrity and tumbled into the
vehicle. “The new Dean’s responsible. Course,”
he added condescendingly, “she ain’t as good as
old Lizzie but she’s sure spiffy!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Janet and Carol chortled with glee.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Spiffy is exactly the word!” Carol declared.</p>

<p class='c008'>At the foot of the hill he let them out and went
on his way.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Miracle number two,” Carol laughed. “Remember
how fond of his old bus he was?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now he is even more proud of this one,”
Madge agreed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Lead me to the drug store,” Janet said firmly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What are we going to do this summer?” Valerie
asked over her chocolate soda.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let’s go camping,” Madge proposed. “We can
have a lot of adventures that way.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hm,” Janet agreed unenthusiastically.</p>

<p class='c008'>“My dad,” Phyllis said slowly, “has offered to
let us use his boat—if we want to.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“If we want to,” Janet echoed gleefully.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Carol Carter! Did you suggest it to Doctor
Elton?” Gale asked, trying to be stern but failing.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well,” Carol murmured, “it might have
slipped out in my conversation with him. You see
I——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We see,” Valerie laughed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Suppose we leave the Adventure Girls here,
discussing their plans for the summer. We shall
join them again for more excitement in The Adventure
Girls on Vacation.</p>
